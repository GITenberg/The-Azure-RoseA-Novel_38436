<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>A novel about Paris that is not about the war
requires even now, I am told, some word of
explanation. Mine is brief:</p>

<p>This story was conceived before the war began.
I came to the task of putting it into its final shape
after nine months passed between the Western
Front and a Paris war-torn and war-darkened,
both physically and spiritually. Yet, though I
had found the old familiar places, and the ever
young and ever familiar people, wounded and sad,
I did not long have to seek for the Parisian bravery
in pain and the Parisian smile shining, rainbowlike,
through the tears. Nothing can conquer
France and nothing can lastingly hurt Paris.
They are, as a famous wit said of our own so different
Boston, a state of mind. Had the German
succeeded in the Autumn of 1914 or the Spring of
1918, France would have remained, and Paris.
What used to happen in the Land of Love and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>viii]</a></span>
the City of Lights will happen there again and be
always happening, so that my story is at once a
retrospect and a prophecy.</p>

<p>Realizing these things, I have found it a pleasure
to make this book. A book without problems
and without horrors, its sole purpose is to give to
the reader some of that pleasure which went to its
making. Wars come and go; but for every man
the Door Opposite stands open beside the Seine,
the hurdy-gurdy plays &ldquo;Annie Laurie&rdquo; in the
Street of the Valley of Grace and&mdash;a Lady of the
Rose is waiting.</p>

<p>He did not know why he headed toward his
own room&mdash;it could hold nothing that he guessed
of to welcome him, except further tokens of the
dejection and misery he carried in his heart&mdash;but
thither he went, and, as he drew nearer, his step
quickened. By the time that he entered the rue
du Val de Gr&acirc;ce, he was moving at something
close upon a run.</p>

<p>He hurried up the rising stairs and into the
dark hall, and, as he did so, was possessed by
the sense that somebody had as hurriedly ascended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
just ahead of him. The door to his room was
never locked, and now he flung it wide.</p>

<p>The last of the afterglow had all but faded
from the sky, and only the faintest twilight, a
rose-pink twilight, came into the studio. Rose-pink:
he thought of that at once and thought, too,
that these sky-roses had a sweeter scent than the
roses of earth, for there was about this once-familiar
place an odor more delicate and tender
than any he had ever known before. It was dim,
illusive; it was like a musical poem in an unknown
tongue, and yet, unlike French scents and hot-house
flowers, it subtly suggested open spaces and
mountain-peaks. Cartaret had a quick vision of
sunlight upon snow-crests. He wondered how
such a perfume could find its way through the
narrow, dirty streets of the Latin Quarter and
into his poor room.</p>

<p>And then, in the dim light, he saw a figure
standing there.</p>

<p>Cartaret stopped short.</p>

<p>An hour ago he had left the place empty.
Now, when he so wanted solitude, it had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
invaded. There was an intruder. It was&mdash;&mdash; yes,
the Lord have mercy on him, it was a girl!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; demanded Cartaret.</p>

<p>He was so startled that he asked the question
in English and with his native American accent.
The next moment, he was more startled when
the strange girl answered him in English, though
an English oddly precise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is I,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is I,&rdquo; was what she said first, and, as she
said it, Cartaret noted that her voice was a wonderfully
soft contralto. What she next said was
uttered as he further discovered himself to her
by an involuntary movement that brought him
within the rear window&rsquo;s shaft of afterglow. It
was:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She spoke with patent amazement, and there
were, between the words, four perceptible
pauses.</p>

<p>What was he doing there? What was <em>she</em>?
What light there was came from behind her: he
could not at all make out her features; he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
only her voice to go by&mdash;only her voice and her
manner of regal possession&mdash;and with neither was
he acquainted. Good Heavens, hadn&rsquo;t he a right
to come unannounced into the one place in Paris
that he might still call his own? It surely <em>was</em>
his own. He looked distractedly about him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; said Cartaret, &ldquo;that this was my
room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His glance, bewildered as it was, nevertheless
assured him that he had not been mistaken. His
accustomed eye detected everything that the twilight
might hide from the eye of a stranger.</p>

<p>Here was all his student-litter. Here were the
good photographs of good pictures, bought second-hand;
the bad copies of good pictures, made by
Cartaret himself during long mornings in the
Louvre, where impudent tourists, staring at his
work, jolted his elbow and craned their necks beside
his cheek; there were the plaster-casts on
brackets&mdash;casts of antiques more mutilated than
the antiques themselves; and here, too, were the
rows of lost endeavors in the shape of discarded
canvases banked on the floor along the walls and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
sometimes jutting far out into the room. Two or
three chairs were scattered about, one with a
broken leg&mdash;he remembered the party at which
it was broken; across from the fire-place was Cartaret&rsquo;s
bed that a tarnished Oriental cover (made
in Lyons) converted by day into a divan; and
close beside the rear window, flanked by the
table on which he mixed his colors, stood, almost
at the elbow of this imperious intruder, Cartaret&rsquo;s
own easel with a virgin canvas in position,
waiting to receive the successor to that picture
which he had sold for a song a few hours ago.</p>

<p>What was he doing here, indeed! He liked
that.</p>

<p>And she was still at it:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How dare you think so?&rdquo; she persisted.</p>

<p>The slight pauses between her words lent them
more weight than, even in his ears, they otherwise
would have possessed. She came a step
nearer, and Cartaret saw that she was breathing
quickly and that the bit of lace above her heart
rose and fell irregularly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How dare you?&rdquo; she repeated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
She was close enough now for him to decide
that she was quite the most striking girl he had
ever seen. Her figure, without a touch of exaggeration,
was full and yet lithe: it moved with
the grace of the athlete. Her skin was rosy and
white&mdash;the rose of health and the clear cream of
sane living.</p>

<p>It was, however, her manner that had led Cartaret
first to doubt his own senses, and then to
doubt hers. This girl spoke like a queen resenting
a next-to-impossible familiarity. He had half
a mind to leave the place and allow her to discover
her own mistake, the nature of which&mdash;his
room ran the length of the old house and half
its width, being separated from a similar room by
only a dark and draughty hallway&mdash;now suddenly
revealed itself to him. He seriously considered
leaving her alone to the advent of her
humiliation.</p>

<p>Then he looked at her again. Her hair, in
sharp contrast to the tint of her face, was a shining
blue-black; though her features were almost
classical in their regularity, her mouth was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
generous and sensitive, and, under even black brows
and through long, curling lashes, her eyes shone
frank and blue. Cartaret decided to remain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are an artist?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave this room!&rdquo; She stamped a little foot.
&ldquo;Leave this room instantly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret stooped to one of the canvases that
were piled against the wall nearest him. He
turned its face to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And this is some of your work?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>He had meant to be only light and amusing,
but when he saw the effect of his action, he cursed
himself for a heavy-witted fool: the girl glanced
first at the picture and then wildly about her.
She had at last realized her mistake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried. Her delicate hands went to
her face. &ldquo;I had just come in and I thought&mdash;I
thought it was <em>my</em> room!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He registered a memorandum to kick himself
as soon as she had gone. He moved awkwardly
forward, still between her and the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Everybody drops in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
here at one time or another, and I never lock my
door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you do not understand!&rdquo; She was still
speaking through her unjeweled fingers: &ldquo;Sir,
we moved into this house only this morning. I
went out for the first time ten minutes since. My
maid did not want me to go, but I would do it.
Our room&mdash;I understand now that our room is
the other one: the one across the hallway. But
I came back hurriedly, a little frightened by the
streets, and I turned&mdash;Oh-h!&rdquo; she ended, &ldquo;I must
go&mdash;I must go immediately!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She dropped her hands and darted forward,
turning to her right. Cartaret lost his head:
he turned to his right. Each saw the mistake
and sought the left; then darted to the right
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me pass!&rdquo; commanded the girl.</p>

<p>Cartaret, inwardly condemning his stupidity,
suddenly backed. He backed into the half open
door; it shut behind him with a sharp snap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not dancing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I know it looks
like it, but I&rsquo;m not&mdash;truly.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
&ldquo;Then stand aside and let me pass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stood aside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;that is what I was trying
to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With her head high, she walked by him to the
door and turned the knob: the door would not
open.</p>

<p>Than the scorn that she turned upon him then,
he had never seen anything more magnificent&mdash;or
more beautiful. &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>He did not know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably stuck,&rdquo; he suggested. She was
beginning to terrify him. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll allow me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He bent to the knob, his hand just brushing
hers, which was quickly withdrawn. He pulled:
the door would not give. He took the knob in
both hands and raised it: no success. He bore all
his weight down upon the knob: the door remained
shut.</p>

<p>He looked up at her attempting the smile of
apology, but her eyes, as soon as they encountered
his, were raised to a calm regard of the panel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
above his head. Cartaret&rsquo;s gaze returned to the
door and, presently, encountered the old deadlatch
that antedated his tenancy and that he had
never once used: it was a deadlatch of a type
antiquated even in the Latin Quarter, tough and
enduring; years ago it had been pushed back and
held open by a small catch; the knob whereby
it was originally worked from inside the room
had been broken off; and now the catch had
slipped, the spring-bolt had shot home and, the
knob being broken, the girl and Cartaret were as
much prisoners in the room as if the lock had
been on the other side of the door.</p>

<p>The American broke into a nervous laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What now?&rdquo; asked the girl, her eyes hard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re caught,&rdquo; said Cartaret.</p>

<p>She could only repeat the word:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Caught?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;m sorry. It was my stupidity; I suppose
I jolted the door rather hard when I bumped
into it, doing that tango just now. Anyhow, this
old lock&rsquo;s sprung into action and we&rsquo;re fastened
in.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
The girl looked at him sharply. A difficult red
climbed her cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Open that door,&rdquo; she ordered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t&mdash;not right away. I&rsquo;ll have to
try to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Open that door instantly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I tell you I can&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo; He
pointed to the offending deadlatch. In embarrassed
sentences, he explained the situation.</p>

<p>She did not appear to listen. She had the air
of one who has prejudged a case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are trying to keep me in this room,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>Her tone was steady, and her eyes were brave;
but it was evident that she quite believed her
statement.</p>

<p>Cartaret colored in his turn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then open the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you the lock has slipped.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that is so, use your key.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any key,&rdquo; protested Cartaret. &ldquo;And
even if I had&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
&ldquo;You have no key to your own room?&rdquo; She
raised her eyes scornfully. &ldquo;I understood you to
say very positively that I was trespassing in <em>your</em>
room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo; cried Cartaret. &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s
my room. You make me wish it wasn&rsquo;t, but it
is. It is my room, but you can see for yourself
there&rsquo;s no keyhole to the confounded lock on this
side of the door, and never was. Look here.&rdquo;
Again he pointed to the deadlatch: &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll
only come a little nearer and look&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I shall remain where
I am.&rdquo; She had put her hand among the lace
over her breast; now the hand, withdrawn, held
an unsheathed knife. &ldquo;And if you come one step
nearer to me,&rdquo; she calmly concluded, &ldquo;I will kill
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the sole dream-touch needed to perfect
his sense of the entire episode&rsquo;s unreality. In
his poor room, a princess that he had never seen
before&mdash;that, surely, he was not seeing now!&mdash;some
royal figure out of a lost Hellenic tragedy;
her breast visibly cumbered by the heavy air of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
modern Paris, her wonderful eyes burning with
the cold fire of resolution, she told him that she
would kill him if he approached her. And she
would do it; she would kill him with less compunction
than she would feel in crushing an offending
moth!</p>

<p>Cartaret had instinctively jumped at the first
flash of the weapon. Now his laughter returned.
A vision could not be impeded by a sprung lock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not here,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>She did not shift by so much as a hairbreadth
her position of defense, yet, ever so slightly, her
eyes widened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not, either,&rdquo; he persisted. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you see? Things like this don&rsquo;t happen. One
of us is asleep and dreaming&mdash;and I must be that
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Plainly she did not follow him, but his laughter
had been so boyishly innocent as to make her
patently doubtful of her own assumption. He
crowded that advantage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Honestly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean any harm&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
&ldquo;You at least place yourself in a strange position,&rdquo;
the girl interrupted, though the hand that
held the knife was lowered to her side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if you really doubt me,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;and don&rsquo;t want to wait until I pick this lock, let
me call from the window and get somebody in
the street to send up the concierge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The street?&rdquo; She evidently did not like this
idea. &ldquo;No, not the street. Why do you not ring
for him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret&rsquo;s gesture included the four walls of
the room:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no bell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still a little suspicious of him, her blue eyes
scanned the room to confirm his statement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why not call him from the window in
the back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because his quarters are at the front of the
house, and he wouldn&rsquo;t hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would no one hear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nobody in the garden at this time of
day. You had really better let me call to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
first person that goes along the street. Somebody
is always going along, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made two strides toward the front window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come back!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned to find her with her face scarlet.
She had raised the knife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Break the lock,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that will take time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Break the lock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right; only why don&rsquo;t you want me to call
for help?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And humiliate me still further?&rdquo; One small
foot, cased in an absurdly light patent-leather
slipper with a flashing buckle, tapped the floor
angrily. &ldquo;I have been foolish, and your folly has
made me more foolish, but I will not have it
known to all the world <em>how</em> foolish I have been.
Break the lock at once&mdash;now&mdash;immediately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret divined that this was eminently a time
for silence: she was alive, she was real, and she
was human. He opened a drawer in the table,
dived under the divan, plunged behind a curtain
in one corner, and at last found a shaky hammer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
and a nicked chisel with which he returned to the
locked door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not much of a carpenter,&rdquo; he said, by way
of preparatory apology.</p>

<p>The girl said nothing.</p>

<p>He was angry at himself for having appeared
to such heavy disadvantage. Consequently, he
was unsteady. His first blow missed. His
strength turned to mere violence, and he showered
futile blows upon the butt of the chisel. Then a
misdirected blow hit the thumb of his left hand.
He swore softly and, having sworn, heard her
laugh.</p>

<p>He looked up: the knife had disappeared. He
was pleased at the change to merriment that her
face discovered; but, as he looked, he realized
that her mirth was launched against his efforts,
and he was pleased no longer. His rage directed
itself from him to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you don&rsquo;t approve,&rdquo; he said sulkily.
&ldquo;For my part, I am quite willing to stop, I assure
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If an imperious person may be said to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
tossed her head, then it should here be said that
this imperious person now tossed hers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, shall I go to the window and yell into
the street?&rdquo; he savagely inquired.</p>

<p>Her high-tilted chin, her crimsoned cheeks and
the studiously managed lack of expression in her
eyes were proofs that she had heard him. Nevertheless,
she persisted in her disregard of his suggestion.</p>

<p>Cartaret&rsquo;s mood became more ugly. He resolved
to make her pay attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; he said, and turned away from
the door.</p>

<p>That brought the answer. She looked at him
in angry horror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And make us the laughing-stock of the neighborhood?&rdquo;
she cried. &ldquo;Is it not enough that you
have shut me in here, that you have insulted me,
that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Insulted you?&rdquo; He stood with the hammer
in one hand and the chisel in the other, a rather
unromantic figure of protest. &ldquo;I never did anything
of the sort.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
He made a flourish and dropped the hammer.
When he picked it up, he saw that she stood
there, looking over his bent head, with eyes sternly
kept serene; but he saw also that her cheeks remained
aglow and that her breath came short.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never did anything of the sort,&rdquo; he went
on. &ldquo;How could I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could you?&rdquo; She clenched her hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that.&rdquo; He could have bitten
out his tongue. He floundered in a marsh
of confusion. &ldquo;I mean&mdash;I mean&mdash;Oh, I don&rsquo;t
know what I mean, except that I beg you to
believe I am incapable of the impudence you
charge! I came in here and found the most
beautiful woman&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She recoiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You speak so to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was out: he had to go ahead now. He did
not at all recognize himself: this was not American;
it was wholly Gallic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go to work,&rdquo; said the girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I want you to understand&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>
Two tears, twin diamonds of mortification,
shone in her blue eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have humiliated me, and mortified me,
and insulted me!&rdquo; she persisted. Her white
throat swallowed the chagrin, and anger returned
to take its place. &ldquo;If you are what you
pretend to be, you will go back to your work of
opening that door. If I were the strong man
that you are, I should have broken it open long
ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had a handsome ferocity. Cartaret put
one broad shoulder to the door and both hands
to the knob. There was a tremendous wrenching
and splitting: the door swung open. He
turned and bowed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s open,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>To his amazement, her mood had entirely
changed. Whether his action had served as
proof of his declared sincerity, or whether her
brief reflection on his words had itself served him
this good turn, he could not guess; but he saw
now that her eyes had softened and that her
underlip quivered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
&ldquo;Good afternoon,&rdquo; said Cartaret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>She moved toward the door, then stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope that you will pardon me,&rdquo; she said,
and she spoke as if she were not accustomed to
asking pardon. &ldquo;I have been too quick and
very foolish. You must know that I am new to
Paris&mdash;new to France&mdash;new to cities&mdash;and that
I have heard strange stories of Parisians and of
the men of the large towns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret was more than mollified, but he took
a grip upon his emotions and resolved to pursue
this advantage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you should have seen
that I was your own sort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My own&mdash;my own sort?&rdquo; She did not seem
to comprehend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, of your own class, then.&rdquo; This girl
had an impish faculty for making him say things
that sounded priggish: &ldquo;You should have seen
I was of your own class.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again her eyes widened. Then she tossed her
head and laughed a little silvery laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>33]</a></span>
He fancied the laugh disdainful, and thought
so the more when she seemed to detect his suspicion
and tried to allay it by an alteration of
tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean exactly that,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>She bit her red lip, and Cartaret noted that
her teeth were even and white.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; she begged.</p>

<p>She put out her hand so frankly that he
would have forgiven her anything. He took the
hand and, as it nestled softer than any satin in
his, he felt his heart hammer in his breast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; she was repeating.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope <em>you&rsquo;ll</em> forgive <em>me</em>,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;At
any rate, you can&rsquo;t forget me: you&rsquo;ll have to
remember me as the greatest boor you ever met.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was I that was foolish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but it wasn&rsquo;t! I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped, for her eyes had fallen from his
and rested on their clasped hands. He released
her instantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; she said again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
&ldquo;Good&mdash;&mdash; But surely I&rsquo;m to see you once in
a while!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;re neighbors! You can&rsquo;t mean that
you won&rsquo;t let me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Good-by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went out, drawing-to the shattered door
behind her.</p>

<p>Cartaret leaned against the panel and listened
shamelessly.</p>

<p>He heard her cross the hall and open the door
to the opposite room; he heard her suspiciously
greeted by another voice&mdash;a voice that he gladly
recognized as feminine&mdash;and in a language that
was wholly unfamiliar to him: a language that
sounded somehow Oriental. Then he heard the
other door shut, and he turned to the comfortless
gloom of his own quarters.</p>

<p>He sat down on the bed. He had forgotten a
riotous dinner that was to have been his final
Parisian folly, forgotten his poverty, forgotten
his day of disappointment and his desire to go
back to Ohio and the law. He remembered only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span>
the events of the last quarter-hour and the girl
that had made them what they were.</p>

<p>As he sat there, there seemed to come again
into the silent room the perfume he had noticed
when he returned. It seemed to float in on the
twilight, still dimly pink behind the roofs of the
gray houses along the Boul&rsquo; Miche&rsquo;: subtle, haunting,
an odor more delicate and tender than any
he had ever known before.</p>

<p>He raised his head. He saw something white
lying on the floor&mdash;lying where, a few moments
since, he had stood. He went forward and
picked it up.</p>

<p>It was a flower like a rose&mdash;a white rose&mdash;but
unlike any rose of which Cartaret had any
knowledge. It was small, but perfect, its pure
petals gathered tight against its heart, and from
its heart came the perfume that had seemed to
him like a musical poem in an unknown tongue.</p>

<p>For a second time Cartaret had that quick
vision of the sunlight upon snow-crests and the
virgin sheen of unattainable mountain tops....</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<br />
<span class="vsmlfont">PROVIDING THE GENTLE READER WITH A CARD

DOVES</span></h2>

</div>


<p>Until just before the appearance of Charlie
Cartaret&rsquo;s rosy vision, this had been a day of
darkness and wet. Rain&mdash;a dull, hopeless, February
rain&mdash;fell with implacable monotony. It
descended in fine spray, as if too lazy to hurry,
yet too spiteful to stop. It made all Paris miserable;
but, as is the way with Parisian rains,
it was a great deal wetter on the Left Bank of
the Seine than on the Right.</p>

<p>No rain&mdash;not even in those happy times before
the great war&mdash;ever washed the Left Bank
clean, and this one only made it a marsh. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
curtain of fog fell sheer between the Isle de la
Cit&eacute; and the Quai des Augustins; the twin
towers of St. Sulpice staggered up into a pall of
fog and were lost in it. The gray houses
hunched their shoulders, lowered their heads,
drew their mansard hats and gabled caps over
their noses and stood like rows of patient horses
at a cabstand under the gray downpour. Now
and again a real cab scuttled along the streets,
its skinny beast clop-clopping over the wooden
paving, or slipping among the cobbled ways,
its driver hidden under a mountainous pile of
woolen great-coat and rubber cape. Even the
taxis lacked the proud air with which they
habitually splash pedestrians, and such pedestrians
as business forced upon the early afternoon
thoroughfares went with heads bowed like
the houses&rsquo; and umbrellas leveled like flying-jibs.</p>

<p>In front of the little Caf&eacute; Des Deux Colombes,
the two marble-topped tables which occupied
its scant frontage on the rue Jacob were
deserted by all save their four iron-backed chairs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
with wet seats and their twin water-bottles into
which, with mathematical precision, water
dropped from a pair of holes in the sagging canvas
overhead. Inside, however, there were
lighted gas-jets, the proprietor and the proprietor&rsquo;s
wife&mdash;presumably the pair of doves for
whom the Caf&eacute; was named&mdash;and a man that
was trying to look like a customer.</p>

<p>Gaston Fran&ccedil;ois Louis Pasbeaucoup had an
apron tied about his middle, and, standing before
the intended patron&rsquo;s table, leaned what
weight he had&mdash;it was not much&mdash;upon his
finger-tips. His mustache was fierce enough to
grace the upper lip of a deputy from the Bouches-du-Rh&ocirc;ne
and generous enough to spare many
a contribution to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">plat-du-jour</i>; but his mustache
was the only large thing about him&mdash;always
excepting Madame his wife, who was ever
somewhere about him and who was just now, two
hundred and twenty pounds of evidence to the
good food of the Deux Colombes, stuffed into
a wire cage at one end of the bar, and bulging
out of it, her eyebrows meeting over her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span>
pug-nose and the heap of hair leaping from her head
nearly to the ceiling, while her lips and fingers
were busy adding the bills from <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d&eacute;jeuner</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would greatly pleasure me to accommodate
monsieur,&rdquo; Pasbeaucoup was whispering, &ldquo;but
monsieur must know that already&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sentence ended in a deprecating glance
over the speaker&rsquo;s shoulder in the general direction
of mighty Madame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Already? Already what then?&rdquo; demanded
the intending customer.</p>

<p>He was lounging on the wall-seat behind his
table, and he had an aristocratic air surprisingly
at variance with his garments. His black jacket
shone too highly at the elbows, and its short
sleeves betrayed an unnecessary length of red
wrist. His black boots gasped for repair; a soft
black hat, pushed to the back of his black hair,
still dripped from an unprotected voyage along
the rainy street, and his neckcloth, which was
also long and soft and black, showed a spot or
two not put there by its makers. These were
patently matters beyond their owner&rsquo;s command
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
and beneath the dignity of his attention. Against
them one was compelled to set a manner truly
lofty, which was enhanced by a pair of burning,
deep-placed eyes, a thin white face and, sprouting
from either side of his lower jaw, near the
chin, two wisps of ebon whisker. He frowned
majestically, and he smoked a caporal cigarette
as if it were a Havana cigar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Already what?&rdquo; he loudly repeated. &ldquo;If it
is possible! I patronize your cabbage of a caf&eacute;
for five years, and now you put me off with
your alreadys!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pasbeaucoup, his fingers still resting on the
table, danced in embarrassment and rolled his
eyes in a manner that plainly enough warned
monsieur not to let his voice reach the caged
lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was but about to say that monsieur already
owes us the trifling sum of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Sixty francs, twenty-five!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tone that announced these fateful numerals
was so tremendous a contralto as to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
really bass. It came from the wire cage and
belonged to Madame.</p>

<p>Pasbeaucoup sank into the nearest chair. He
spread out his hands in a gesture that eloquently
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ve done it! I can&rsquo;t shield you
any longer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The debtor, albeit he was still a young man,
did not appear unduly impressed. The table
was across his knees, but he rose as far as it
would permit and removed his hat with a flourish
that sent a spray of water directly over
Madame&rsquo;s monument of hair. Disregarding
the blatant fact that she was quite the most
remarkable feature of the room, he vowed that
he had not observed her upon entering, was
desolated because of his oversight and ravished
now to have the pleasure of once more beholding
her in all her accustomed grace and charm.</p>

<p>Madame shrugged her shoulders higher than
the walls of the cage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sixty francs, twenty-five,&rdquo; she said, without
looking up from her task.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
Ah, yes: his little account. Monsieur recalled
that: there was a little account; but, so truly as
his name was Seraphin and his passion Art, what
a marvelous head Madame had for figures. It
was of an exactitude magnificent!</p>

<p>When he paused, Madame said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sixty francs, twenty-five.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But surely, Madame&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Seraphin Dieudonn&eacute;
was politely amazed; he did not desire to
credit her with an impoliteness, and yet she
seemed to imply that, unless he paid this absurdly
little sum, there might be some delay in
serving him in this so excellent establishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C&rsquo;est &ccedil;a</i>,&rdquo; said Madame. &ldquo;The delay will
be entire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Incomprehensible!&rdquo; Seraphin put a bony
hand to his heart. &ldquo;Do you not know&mdash;all the
world of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quartier</i> knows&mdash;that I have, Madame,
but three days&rsquo; work more upon my <i>magnum
opus</i>&mdash;a week at the utmost&mdash;and that then
it can sell for not a sou less than fifteen thousand
francs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame&rsquo;s face never changed expression when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
she talked; it always seemed set at the only angle
that would balance her monument of hair. She
now said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What all the world of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quartier</i> knows is
that your last <i>magnum opus</i> you sold to that
simpleton Fourget in the rue St. Andr&eacute; des
Arts; that even from him you could squeeze but
a hundred francs for it; and that he has not yet
been able to find a customer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At first Seraphin seemed slow to credit the
scorn that Madame was at such pains to reveal.
He made one valiant effort to overlook it, and
failed; then he made an effort no less valiant to
meet her with the ridiculous majesty in which
he habitually draped himself. It was as if, unable
to make her believe in him, he at least
wanted her to believe that his long struggle
with poverty and an indifferent public had served
only to increase his confidence in his own genius
and to rear between him and the world a wall
through which the arrows of the scornful could
hardly pass. But this attempt succeeded no
more than its predecessor: as he half stood, half
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
bent before this landlady of a fifth-rate caf&eacute;, a
tardy pink crept up his white face and painted
the skin over his cheek-bones; his eyelids fluttered,
and his mouth worked. The man was
hungry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madeleine!&rdquo; whispered Pasbeaucoup, compassion
for the debtor almost overcoming fear
of the wife.</p>

<p>Seraphin wet his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sixty francs, twenty-five,&rdquo; said Madame.
&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ca y est!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she said it, the door of the Deux Colombes
opened and another patron, at once evidently
a more welcome patron, presented himself. He
was a plump little man with hands that were
thinly at contrast with the rest of him. He
was fairly well dressed, but far better fed, and
so contented with his lot as to have no eye for
the evident lot of Seraphin. He was Maurice
Houdon, who had decided some day to be a
great composer and who meanwhile overcharged
a few English and American pupils for lessons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span>
on the piano and borrowed money from any
that would trust him. He stormed Dieudonn&eacute;,
leaned over the intervening table and embraced
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear friend!&rdquo; he cried, his arms outflung,
his fingers rattling rapid arpeggios upon invisible
pianos. &ldquo;You are indeed well found. I have
news&mdash;such news!&rdquo; He thrust back his head
and warbled a laugh worthy of the mad-scene
in <i>Lucia</i>. &ldquo;Listen well.&rdquo; Again he embraced
the unresisting Seraphin. &ldquo;This night we dine
here; we make a collation&mdash;a symposium: we
feed both our bodies and our souls. I shall sit
at the head of the table in the little room on
the first floor, and you will sit at the foot.
Armand Garnier will read his new poem; Devignes
will sing my latest song; Philippe Varachon
and you will discourse on your arts; and
I&mdash;perhaps I shall let you persuade me to play
the fugue that I go to write for the death of the
President: it is all but ready against the day
that a president chooses to die.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
But Seraphin&rsquo;s thoughts were fixed on the
food for the body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You make no jest with me, Maurice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jest with you? I jest with you? No, my
friend. I do not jest when I invite a guest to
dine with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I comprehend,&rdquo; said Dieudonn&eacute;; &ldquo;but who
is to be the host?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that question, Pasbeaucoup rose from his
chair, and Madame, his wife, tried to thrust her
nose, which was too short to reach, through the
bars of her cage. The composer struck a chord
on his breast and bowed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;True: the host,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I had forgotten.
I have found a veritable patron of my art. He
has had the room above mine for two years,
and I did not once before suspect him. He is
an American of the United States.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame&rsquo;s contralto shook her prison bars:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no American that can appreciate
art.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True, Madame,&rdquo; admitted Houdon, bowing
profoundly; &ldquo;there is no American that can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
appreciate art, and there is no American millionaire
that can help patronizing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh, he is a millionaire, then, this American?&rdquo;
demanded Madame, audibly mollified.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has that honor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And his name?&rdquo;&mdash;Madame wanted to make
a memorandum of that name.</p>

<p>Houdon struck another chord. It was as if
he were sounding a fanfare for the entrance of
his hero.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charles Cartaret.&rdquo; He pronounced the first
name in the French fashion and the second
name &ldquo;Cartarette.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seraphin&rsquo;s reply to this announcement rather
spoiled its effect. He laughed, and his laughter
was high and mocking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cartaret!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Charlie Cartaret! But
I know him well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;&mdash;The composer was reproachful&mdash;&ldquo;And
you never presented him to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It never happened that you were by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My faith! Why should I be? Am I not
Houdon? You should have brought him to me.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
Is it that you at the same time consider yourself
my friend and do not bring to me your millionaire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seraphin&rsquo;s laughter waxed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he is not my millionaire: he is your
millionaire only. I know well that he is as
poor as we are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The musician&rsquo;s imaginary melody ceased: one
could almost hear it cease. He gazed at Seraphin
as he might have gazed at a madman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that room rents for a hundred francs
a month!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is in debt for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And his name is that of a rich American
well known.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An uncle who does not like him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he has offered to provide this collation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seraphin shrugged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;M. Cartaret&rsquo;s credit,&rdquo; said he, with a glance
at Madame, &ldquo;seems to be better than mine. I
tell you he is only a young art-student, enough
genteel, and the relation of a man enough rich,
but for himself&mdash;poof!&mdash;he is one of us.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<br />
<span class="vsmlfont">IN WHICH A FOOL AND HIS MONEY ARE SOON
PARTED</span></h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Money&rsquo;s the still sweet-singing nightingale.&mdash;Herrick:
<i>Hesperides</i>.</p>
</div>


<p>Seraphin Dieudonn&eacute; told the truth: at that
moment Charlie Cartaret&mdash;for all this, remember,
preceded the coming of the Vision&mdash;at
that moment Cartaret was seated in his room
in the rue du Val-de-Gr&acirc;ce, wondering how he
was to find his next month&rsquo;s rent. His trouble
was that he had just sold a picture, for the first
time in his life, and, having sold it, he had
rashly engaged to celebrate that good fortune by a
feast which would leave him with only enough
to buy meals for the ensuing three weeks.</p>

<p>He was a rather fine-looking, upstanding
young fellow of a type essentially American.
In the days, not long distant, when the goal at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
the other end of the gridiron had been the only
goal of his ambition, he had put hard muscles
on his hardy frame; later he had learned to shoot
in Arizona; and he even now would have
looked more at home along Broadway or Halsted
Street than he did in the rue St. Jacques
or the Boulevard St. Michel. He was tow-haired
and brown-eyed and clean-shaven; he
was generally hopeful, which is another way of
saying that he was still upon the flowered slope
of twenty-five.</p>

<p>Cartaret had inherited his excellent constitution,
but his family all suffered from one disease:
the disease of too much money on the
wrong side of the house. When oil was found
in Ohio, it was found in land belonging to his
father&rsquo;s brother, but Charlie&rsquo;s father remained
a poor lawyer to the end of his days. Uncle
Jack had children of his own and a deserved
reputation for holding on to his pennies. He
sent his niece to a finishing-school, where she
could be properly prepared for that state of life
to which it had not pleased Heaven to call her,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>51]</a></span>
and he sent his nephew to college. When the
former child was finished, he found her a place
as companion to an ancient widow in Toledo
and dismissed her from his thoughts; when
Charlie was through with college&mdash;which is to
say, when the faculty was through with him
for endeavoring to plant a fraternity in a plot
of academic soil that forbade the seed of Greek-letter
societies&mdash;he asked him what he intended
to do now&mdash;and asked it in a tone that plainly
meant:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What further disgrace are you planning to
bring upon our name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Charlie replied that he wanted to be an artist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might have guessed it,&rdquo; said his uncle.
&ldquo;How long&rsquo;ll it take?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Young Cartaret, knowing something about art,
had not the slightest idea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the by-product of petroleum, &ldquo;if
you&rsquo;ve got to be an artist, be one as far away
from New York as you can. They say Paris is
the best place to learn the business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is one of the best places,&rdquo; said Charlie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
The elder Cartaret wrote a check.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take a boat to-morrow,&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
pay your board and tuition for two years: that&rsquo;s
time enough to learn any business. After two
years you&rsquo;ll have to make out for yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Charlie had worked hard for two years.
That period ended a week ago, and his uncle&rsquo;s
checks ended with it. He had stayed on and
hoped. To-day he had carried a picture through
the rain to Seraphin&rsquo;s benefactor, the dealer
Fourget; and the soft-hearted Fourget had bought
it. Cartaret, on his return, met Houdon in the
lower hall and before the American was well
aware of it, he was pledged to the feast of
which Maurice was bragging to Dieudonn&eacute;.</p>

<p>Charlie dug into his pocket and fished out all
that was in it: a matter of two hundred and
ten francs. He counted it twice over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No use,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make it any
larger. I wonder if I ought to take a smaller
room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Certainly there was more room here than he
wanted, but he had grown to love the place:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
even then, when he had still to see it in the
rose-pink twilight of romance, in the afterglow
that was a dawn&mdash;even then, before the apparition
of the strange Lady&mdash;he loved it as his
sort of man must love the scenes of those
struggles which have left him poor. Its front
windows opened upon the street full of student-life
and gossip, its rear windows looked on a
little garden that was pretty with the concierge&rsquo;s
flowers all Summer long and merry with
the laughter of the concierge&rsquo;s children on every
fair day the whole year round. The light was
good enough, the location excellent; the service
was no worse than the service in any similar
house in Paris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I have been a fool,&rdquo; said Cartaret.</p>

<p>He looked again at his money, and then he
looked again about the room. The difference
between a fool and a mere dilettante in folly is
this: that the latter knows his folly as he indulges
it, whereas the former recognizes it, if
ever, only too late.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
&ldquo;If I&rsquo;d been able to study for only one year
more,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>It was the wail of retrospection that, sooner
or later, every man, each in his own way and
according to his chances and his character for
seizing them, is bound to utter. It was what
we all say and what, in saying, we each think
unique. Happy he that says it, and means it,
in time to profit!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Cartaret, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a fool. But
I won&rsquo;t be a quitter,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and
order that dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus Charles Cartaret in the afternoon.</p>

<p>He had put on a battered, broad-brimmed
hat of soft black felt, which was picturesquely
out of place above his American features, and a
still more battered English rain-coat, which did
not at all belong with the hat, and, thus fortified
against the rain, he hurried into the hall.
As he closed the door of his studio behind him,
he fancied that he heard a sound from the
room across from his own, and so stood listening,
his hand upon the knob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;I thought that
room was still to let.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He listened a moment longer, but the sound,
if sound there had been, was not repeated, so
he pulled his hat-brim over his eyes and descended
to the street.</p>

<p>The rain had lessened, but the fog held on,
and the thoroughfares were wet and dismal.
Cartaret cut down the rue du Val-de-Gr&acirc;ce to
the Avenue de Luxembourg and through the
gardens with their dripping statues and around
the museum, whence he crossed to the sheltered
way between those bookstalls that cling like ivy
to the walls of the Od&eacute;on, and so, by the steep
descent of the rue de Tournon and the rue de Seine,
came to the rue Jacob and the Caf&eacute; Des Deux
Colombes.</p>

<p>Seraphin and Maurice were still there. They
received him as their separate natures dictated,
the former with a restrained dignity, the latter
with the dignity of a monarch so secure of
his title that he can afford to condescend to an
air of democracy. Seraphin bowed; Maurice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
embraced and, embracing, tapped the diatonic
scale along Cartaret&rsquo;s vertebr&aelig;. Pasbeaucoup,
in trembling obedience to a cryptic nod from
the caged Madame, hovered in the background.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have come,&rdquo; said Cartaret, whose French
was the easy and inaccurate French of the
American art-student, &ldquo;to order that dinner.&rdquo;
He half turned to Pasbeaucoup, but Houdon
was before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is done,&rdquo; announced the musician, as if
announcing a favor performed. &ldquo;I have relieved
you of that tedium. We are to begin
with an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors-d&rsquo;oeuvre</i> of anchovies and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame had again nodded, this time less
cryptically and more violently, at her husband,
and Pasbeaucoup, between twin terrors, timidly
suggested:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur Cartaret comprehends that it is
only because of the so high cost of necessities
that it is necessary for us to request&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped there, but the voice from the
cage boomed courageously:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The payment in advance!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>57]</a></span>
&ldquo;A custom of the establishment,&rdquo; explained
Houdon grandly, but shooting a venomous glance
in the direction of Madame.</p>

<p>Seraphin came quietly from behind his table
and, slipping a thin arm through Cartaret&rsquo;s,
drew him, to the speechless amazement of the
other participants in this scene, toward the farthest
corner of the caf&eacute;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;you must not do
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; said Cartaret. &ldquo;Why not? It&rsquo;s a
queer thing to be asked, but why shouldn&rsquo;t I
do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seraphin hesitated. Then, regaining the conquest
over self, he put his lips so close to the
American&rsquo;s ear that the Frenchman&rsquo;s wagging
wisps of whisker tickled his auditor&rsquo;s cheek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This Houdon is but a pleasant <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coquin</i>,&rdquo; he
confided. &ldquo;He will suck from you the last sou&rsquo;s
worth of your blood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret smiled grimly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t get a fortune by it,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is why I do not wish him to do it:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span>
I know well that you cannot afford these little
dissipations. I do not wish to see my friend
swindled by false friendship. Houdon is a good
boy, but, Name of a Name, he has the conscience
of a pig!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Cartaret suddenly, for Seraphin
was appealing to a sense of economy still
fresh enough to be sensitive, &ldquo;since he&rsquo;s ordered
the dinner, we&rsquo;ll let him pay for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; declared Dieudonn&eacute;, sadly shaking his
long hair, &ldquo;poor Maurice has not the money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;&mdash;A gleam of gratitude lighted Cartaret&rsquo;s
blue eyes&mdash;&ldquo;Then you are proposing that
you do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; inquired Seraphin, flinging out
his arms as a man flings out his arms to invite
a search of his pockets, &ldquo;you know me: how
can I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret blushed at his ineptitude. He knew
Dieudonn&eacute; well enough to have been aware of
his poverty and liked him well enough to be
tender toward it. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he nevertheless pardonably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
inquired, &ldquo;if that&rsquo;s the way the thing stands,
who&rsquo;s to pay? One of the other guests?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are all of the same financial ability.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I don&rsquo;t see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor do I. And&rdquo;&mdash;Seraphin&rsquo;s high resolution
clattered suddenly about his ears&mdash;&ldquo;after
all, the dinner has been ordered, and I am very
hungry. My friend,&rdquo; he concluded with a happy
return of his dignity, &ldquo;at least I have done you
this service: you will buy the dinner, but you
will not both buy it and be deceived.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret turned, with a smile no longer grim,
to the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seraphin,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;has persuaded me.
Madame, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l&rsquo;addition</i>, if you please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pasbeaucoup trotted to the cage, bringing
back to Cartaret the long slip of paper that
Madame had ready for him. Cartaret glanced
at only the total and, though he flushed a little,
paid without comment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; suggested Houdon, &ldquo;now let us
play a little game of dominoes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seraphin, from the musician&rsquo;s shoulder,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
frowned hard at Cartaret, but Cartaret was in
no mood to heed the warning. He was angry
at himself for his extravagance and decided that,
having been such a fool as to fling away a great
deal of his money, he might now as well be a
greater fool and fling it all away. Besides, he
might be able to win from Houdon, and, even
if Houdon could not pay, there would be the
satisfaction of revenge. So he sat down at one
of the marble-topped tables and began, with a
great clatter, to shuffle the dominoes that obsequious
Pasbeaucoup hurriedly fetched. Within
two hours, Seraphin was head over ears in the
musician&rsquo;s debt, and the American was paying
into Houdon&rsquo;s palm all but about ten francs
of the money that he had so recently earned.
He rose smilingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not go?&rdquo; inquired Houdon.</p>

<p>Cartaret nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the dinner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry; I&rsquo;ll be back for that&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ll get another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then permit me,&rdquo; Houdon condescended,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
&ldquo;to order a bock. For the three of us.&rdquo; He
generously included the hungry Seraphin. &ldquo;Come,
we shall drink to your better fortune next
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Cartaret excused himself. He said that
he had an engagement with a dealer, which was
not true, and which was understood to be false,
and he went into the street.</p>

<p>The last of the rain, unnoticed during Cartaret&rsquo;s
fevered play, had passed, and a red February
sun was setting across the Seine, behind
the higher ground that lies between L&rsquo;Etoile and
the Place du Trocadero. The river was hidden
by the point of land that ends in the Quai
D&rsquo;Orsay, but, as Cartaret crossed the broad rue
de Vaugirard, he could see the golden afterglow
and, silhouetted against it, the high filaments
of the Eiffel Tower.</p>

<p>What an ass he had been, he bitterly reflected,
as he passed again through the Luxembourg
Gardens, where now the statues glistened
in the fading light of the dying afternoon. What
a mad ass! If a single stroke of almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
pathetically small good luck made such a fool of
him, it was as well that his uncle and not his
father had come into a fortune.</p>

<p>His thought went back with a new tenderness
to his father and to his own and his sister
Cora&rsquo;s early life in that small Ohio town. He
had hated the dull routine and narrow conventionality
of the place. There the most daring
romance of youth had been to walk with the
daughter of a neighbor along the shaded streets
in the Summer evenings, and to hang over the
gate to the front yard of the house in which
she lived, tremblingly hinting at a delicious
tenderness, which one never dared more adequately
to express, until a threatening parental
voice called the girl to shelter. His life, since
those days, had been more stirring, and sometimes
more to be regretted; but he had loved it
and thought it absurd sentiment on Cora&rsquo;s part
to insist that their tiny income go to keeping
up the little property&mdash;the three-story brick
house and wide front and back-yard along Main
Street&mdash;which had been their home. Yet now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>63]</a></span>
he felt, and was half ashamed of feeling, a
strong desire to go back there, a pull at his
heartstrings for a return to all that he was once
so anxious to quit forever.</p>

<p>He wondered if it could be possible that he
was tired of Paris. He even wondered if it
were possible that he could not be a successful
artist&mdash;he had never wanted to be a rich one&mdash;whether
the sensible course would not be to
go home and study law while there was yet
time....</p>

<p>And then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Then, in the rose-pink twilight, the beginning
of the Dream Wonderful: that scent of the
roses from the sky; that quick memory of sunlight
upon snow-crests; that first revelation of
the celestial Lady transfiguring the earthly commonplace
of his room!</p>

<span class="vsmlfont">A DAMSEL IN DISTRESS</span></h2>

<p>Charlie Cartaret would have told you&mdash;indeed,
he frequently did tell his friends&mdash;that
the mere fact of a man being an artist was
no proof that he lacked in the uncommon sense
commonly known as common. Cartaret was
quite insistent upon this and, as evidence in
favor of his contention, he was accustomed to
point to C. Cartaret, Esq. He, said Cartaret,
was at once an artist and a practical man: it
was wholly impossible, for instance, to imagine
him capable of any silly romance.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when left alone in his room by
the departure of the Lady on that February
evening, he sat for a long time with the strange
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>65]</a></span>
rose between his fingers and a strange look in his
eyes. He regarded the rose until the last ray of
light had altogether faded from the West. Only
then did he recall that he had invited sundry
persons to dine with him at the Caf&eacute; Des Deux
Colombes, and when he had made ready to go to
them, the rose was still in his reluctant hand.</p>

<p>Cartaret looked about him stealthily. He had
been in the room for some hours and he should
have been thoroughly aware that he was alone
in it; but he looked, as all guilty men do, to
right and left to make sure. Then, like a
naughty child, he turned his back to the street-window.</p>

<p>He stood thus a bare instant, yet in that
instant his hand first raised something toward
his lips, and then bestowed that same something
somewhere inside his waistcoat, a considerable
distance from his heart, but directly over
the rib beneath which ill-informed people believe
the heart to be. This accomplished, he
exhibited a rigorously practical face to the room
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>
and swaggered out of it, ostentatiously humming
a misogynistic drinking-song:</p>

<div class="cpoem2">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing, friend, &rsquo;twixt you and me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Except the best of company.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">(There&rsquo;s just one bock &rsquo;twixt you and me,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">and I&rsquo;ll catch up full soon!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What woman&rsquo;s lips compare to this:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This sturdy seidel&rsquo;s frothy kiss&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Armand Garnier, one of the men that were
to dine with Cartaret to-night, had written the
words of which this is a free translation, and
Houdon had composed the air&mdash;he composed it
impromptu for Devignes over an absinthe, after
laboring upon it in secret for an entire week&mdash;but
Cartaret, when he reached the note that
stood for the last word here given, came to an
abrupt stop; he was facing the door of the room
opposite his own. He continued facing it for
quite a minute, but he heard nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;M. Refrogn&eacute;,&rdquo; he said, when he thrust his
head into the concierge&rsquo;s box downstairs, &ldquo;if&mdash;er&mdash;if
anybody should inquire for me this evening,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>67]</a></span>
you will please tell them that I am dining at
the Caf&eacute; Des Deux Colombes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nothing could be seen in the concierge&rsquo;s box,
but from it came a grunt that might have been
either assent or dissent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Cartaret, &ldquo;in the rue Jacob.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again the ambiguous grunt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; Cartaret agreed; &ldquo;the Caf&eacute; Des
Deux Colombes, in the rue Jacob, close by the
rue Bonaparte. You&mdash;you&rsquo;re quite sure you
won&rsquo;t forget?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The grunt changed to an ugly chuckle, and,
after the chuckle, an ugly voice said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur expects something unusual: he expects
an evening visitor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confound it, no!&rdquo; snapped Cartaret. He
had been wildly hoping that perhaps The Girl
might need some aid or direction that evening
and might seek it of him. &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; he
pursued, &ldquo;but you see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How then?&rdquo; inquired the voice.</p>

<p>Cartaret&rsquo;s hand went to his pocket and drew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>68]</a></span>
forth one of the few franc-pieces that remained
there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just, please, remember what I&rsquo;ve said,&rdquo; he
requested.</p>

<p>In the darkness of the box into which it was
extended, his hand was grasped by a larger
and rougher hand, and the franc was deftly
extracted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Merci, monsieur.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>A barely appreciable softening of the tone encouraged
Cartaret. He balanced himself from
foot to foot and asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those people&mdash;the ones, you understand, that
have rented the room opposite mine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Refrogn&eacute; understood but truly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;in short, who are they, monsieur?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; asked Refrogn&eacute; in the darkness.
Cartaret could feel him shrug.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rather thought you might,&rdquo; he ventured.</p>

<p>The darkness was silent; a good concierge
answers questions, not general statements.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&mdash;don&rsquo;t you know where they come
from?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>69]</a></span>
There was speech once more. Refrogn&eacute;, it
said, neither knew nor cared. In the rue du
Val de Gr&acirc;ce people continually came and went&mdash;all
manner of people from all manner of
places&mdash;so long as they paid their rent, it was
no concern of Refrogn&eacute;&rsquo;s. For all the information
that he possessed, the two people of whom
monsieur inquired might be natives of Cochin-China.
Mademoiselle evidently wanted to be
an artist, as scores of other young women, and
Madame, her guardian and sole companion, evidently
wanted Mademoiselle to be nothing at
all. There were but two of them, thank God!
The younger spoke much French with an accent
terrible; the elder understood French, but spoke
only some pig of a language that no civilized man
could comprehend. That was all that Refrogn&eacute;
had to tell.</p>

<p>Cartaret went on toward the scene of his dinner-party.
He wished he did not have to go.
On the other hand, he was sure he had thrown
Refrogn&eacute; a franc to no purpose: the Lady of the
Rose was little likely to seek him! He found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
the evening cold and his rain-coat inadequate.
He began humming the drinking-song again.</p>

<p>They were singing it outright, in a full chorus,
when he entered the little room on the first floor
of the Caf&eacute; Des Deux Colombes. The table was
already spread, the feast already started. The
unventilated room was flooded with light and
full of the steam of hot viands.</p>

<p>Maurice Houdon, his red cheeks shining, his
black mustache stiffly waxed, sat at the head
of the table as he had promised to do, performing
the honors with a regal grace and playing
imaginary themes with every flourish of address
to every guest: a different theme for each. On
his right was a vacant place, the sole apparent
reference to the host of the evening; on his left,
Armand Garnier, the poet, very thin and cadaverous,
with long dank locks and tangled beard, his
skin waxen, his lantern-jaw emitting no words,
but working lustily upon the food. Next to Cartaret&rsquo;s
place bobbed the pear-shaped Devignes,
leading the chorus, as became the only professional
singer in the company. Across from him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>71]</a></span>
was Philippe Varachon, the sculptor, whose nose
always reminded Cartaret of an antique and long
lost bit of statuary, badly damaged in exhumation;
and at the foot Seraphin was seated, the
first to note Cartaret&rsquo;s arrival and the only one
to apologize for not having delayed the dinner.</p>

<p>He got up immediately, and his whiskers
tickled the American&rsquo;s cheek with the whisper:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was ready to serve, and Madame swore
that it would perish. My faith, what would
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pasbeaucoup was darting among the guests,
wiping fresh plates with a napkin and his dripping
forehead with his bare hand. Cartaret felt
certain that the little man would soon confuse
the functions of the two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah-h-h!&rdquo; cried Houdon. He rose from his
place and endeavored to restore order by beating
with a fork upon an empty tumbler, as an orchestral
conductor taps his baton&mdash;at the same
time nodding fiercely at Pasbeaucoup to refill
the tumbler with red wine. He was the sole member
of the company not long known to their host,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>72]</a></span>
but he said: &ldquo;Messieurs, I have the happiness
to present to you our distinguished American
fellow-student, M. Charles Cartar<em>ette</em>. Be seated
among us, M. Cartarette,&rdquo; he graciously added;
&ldquo;pray be seated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret sat down in the place kindly reserved
for him, and the interruption of his appearance
was so politely forgotten that he wished he had
not been such a fool as to make it. The song
was resumed. It was not until the salad was
served and Pasbeaucoup had retired below-stairs
to assist in preparing the coffee, that Houdon
turned again to Cartaret and executed what was
clearly to be the Cartaret theme.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had despaired of your arrival, Monsieur,&rdquo;
said he.</p>

<p>Cartaret said he had observed signs of something
of the sort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; nodded Houdon. His tongue rolled
a ball of salad into his cheek and out of the
track of speech. &ldquo;Doubtless you had the one
living excuse, however.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t follow you,&rdquo; said Cartaret.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>73]</a></span>
Houdon leered. His fingers performed on the
table-cloth something that might have been the
<i>motif</i> of Isolde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;your American proverb
that there are but two adequate excuses
for tardiness at dinner&mdash;death and a lady&mdash;and
I am charmed, monsieur, to observe that
you are altogether alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If Cartaret&rsquo;s glance indicated that he would
like to throttle the composer, Cartaret&rsquo;s glance
did not misinterpret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t discuss that, if you please,&rdquo; said
he.</p>

<p>But Houdon was incapable of understanding
such glances in such a connection. He tapped
for the attention of his orchestra and got it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Messieurs,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;our good friend
of the America of the North has been having an
adventure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everybody looked at Cartaret and everybody
smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Delicious,&rdquo; squeaked Varachon through his
broken nose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>74]</a></span>
&ldquo;Superb,&rdquo; trilled the pear-shaped singer Devignes.</p>

<p>Garnier&rsquo;s lantern-jaws went on eating. Seraphin
Dieudonn&eacute; caught Cartaret&rsquo;s glance imploringly
and then shifted, in ineffectual warning,
to Houdon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that was only what was to be expected,
my children,&rdquo; the musician continued. &ldquo;What
can we poor Frenchmen look for when a blond
Hercules of an American comes, rich and handsome,
to our dear Paris? Only to-day I observed,
renting an abode in the house that Monsieur and
I have the honor to share, a young mademoiselle,
the most gracious and beautiful, accompanied
by a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tuteur</i>, the most ferocious; and I noted well
that they went to inhabit the room but across the
landing from that of M. Cartarette. Behold all!
At once I said to myself: &lsquo;Alas, how long will
it be before this confiding&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped short and looked at Cartaret, for
Cartaret had grasped the performing hand of
the composer and, in a steady grip, forced it
quietly to the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>75]</a></span>
&ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; said Cartaret, gently, &ldquo;that I
don&rsquo;t care to have you talk in this strain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How then?&rdquo; blustered the amazed musician.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you go on,&rdquo; Cartaret warned him, &ldquo;you will
have to go on from the floor; I&rsquo;ll knock you
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maurice!&rdquo; cried Seraphin, rising from his
chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Messieurs!&rdquo; piped Devignes.</p>

<p>Varachon growled at Houdon, and Garnier
reached for a water-bottle as the handiest weapon
of defense. Houdon and Cartaret were facing
each other, erect, each waiting for the other to
make a further move, the former red, the latter
white, with anger. There followed that flashing
pause of quiet which is the precursor of
battle.</p>

<p>The battle, however, was not forthcoming.
Instead, through the silence, there came a roar
of voices that diverted the attention of even
the chief combatants. It was a roar of voices
from the caf&eacute; below: a heavy rumble that was
unmistakably Madame&rsquo;s and a clatter of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>76]</a></span>
unintelligible shrieks and demands that were feminine
but unclassifiable. Now one voice shouted and
next the other. Then the two joined in a
mighty explosion, and little Pasbeaucoup was
shot up the stairs and among the diners as if
he were the first rock from the crater of an
emptying volcano.</p>

<p>He staggered against the table and jolted the
water-bottle out of the poet&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Name of a Name!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;She is a
veritable tigress, that woman there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had no time then to inquire whom he
referred to, though they knew that, however
justly he might think it, he would never, even
in terror like the present, say such a thing of
his wife. The words were no sooner free of his
lips than a larger rock was vomited from the
volcano, and a still larger, the largest rock of
the three, came immediately after.</p>

<p>Everybody was afoot now. They saw that
Pasbeaucoup cowered against the wall in a fear
terrible because it was greater than his fear for
Madame; they saw that Madame, who was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>77]</a></span>
third rock, was clinging to the apron-strings of
another woman, who was rock number two, and
they saw that this other woman was a stocky
figure, who carried in her hand a curious, wide
head-dress, and who wore a parti-colored apron
that began over her ample breasts and ended
by brushing against her equally ample boots, and
a black skirt of simple stuff and extravagant
puffs, surmounted by a short-skirted blouse or
basque of the same material. Her face was
round and wrinkled like a last winter&rsquo;s apple
on the kitchen-shelf; but her eyes shone red,
her hands beat the air vigorously, and from her
lips poured a lusty torrent of sounds that might
have been protestations, appeals or curses, yet
were certainly, considered as words, nothing
that any one present had ever heard before.</p>

<p>She ran forward; Madame ran forward. The
stranger shouldered Madame; Madame dragged
her back. The stranger cried out more of her
alien phrases; Madame shouted French denunciations.
The Gallic diners formed a grinning
circle, eager to lose no detail of the sort of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>78]</a></span>
wrangle that a Frenchman loves best to watch:
a wrangle between women.</p>

<p>Cartaret made his way through the ring and
put his hand on the stranger&rsquo;s shoulder. She
seemed to understand, and relapsed into quiet,
attentive but alert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Cartaret, &ldquo;one at a time, please.
Madame, what is the trouble?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trouble?&rdquo; roared Madame. Her face did
not change expression, but she held her arms
akimbo, pug-nose and strong chin poked defiantly
at the strange interloper. &ldquo;You may well
say it, trouble!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She put her position strongly and at length.
She had been in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">caisse</i>, with no one of the
world in the caf&eacute;, when, crying barbarous
threats incomprehensible, this she-bandit, this&mdash;this
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">anarchiste inf&acirc;me</i>, had burst in from the
street, disrupting the peace of the Deux Colombes
and endangering its well-known quiet reputation
with the police.</p>

<p>That was the gist of it. When it was delivered,
Cartaret faced the stranger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>79]</a></span>
&ldquo;And you, Madame?&rdquo; he asked, in French.</p>

<p>The stranger strode forward as a pugilist steps
from his corner for the round that he expects to
win the fight for him. She clapped her wide
head-dress upon her head, where it settled itself
with a rakish tilt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Holy pipe!&rdquo; cried Houdon. &ldquo;In that I recognize
her. It is the ferocious <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tuteur</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret&rsquo;s interest became tense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you want here?&rdquo; he urged, still
speaking French.</p>

<p>The stranger said, twice over, something that
sounded like &ldquo;Kar-kar-tay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is mad,&rdquo; squeaked Varachon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is worse; she is German,&rdquo; vowed Madame.</p>

<p>Cartaret raised his hand to silence these contentions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you understand me?&rdquo; he urged.</p>

<p>The wide head-dress flapped a vehement assent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t answer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The head-dress fluttered a negative, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>80]</a></span>
mouth mumbled a negative in a French so thick,
hesitant and broken as to be infinitely less expressive
than the shake of the head.</p>

<p>Cartaret remembered what the concierge Refrogn&eacute;
had told him. To the circle of curious
people he explained:</p>

<p>&ldquo;She can understand a little French, but she
cannot speak it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame snorted. &ldquo;Why then does she come
to this place so respectable if she cannot talk
like a Christian?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Cartaret, &ldquo;she evidently
thought she would be intelligently treated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was clear to him that she would not have
come had her need not been desperate. He
made another effort to discover her nationality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who of you speaks something besides
French?&rdquo; he asked of the company.</p>

<p>Not Madame; not Seraphin or Houdon: they
were ardent Parisians and of course knew no
language but their own. As for Garnier,
as a French poet and a native of the pure-tongued
Tours, he would not have soiled his lips with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>81]</a></span>
any other speech had he known another. Varachon,
it turned out, was from the Jura, and
had picked up a little Swiss-German during a
youthful <i>liaison</i> at Pontarlier. He tried it now,
but the stranger only shook her head-dress at
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She knows no German,&rdquo; said Varachon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such German!&rdquo; sniffed Houdon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chut! This proves rather that she knows it
too well,&rdquo; grumbled Madame. &ldquo;She but wishes
to conceal it; probably she is a German spy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Devignes said he knew Italian, and he did
seem to know a sort of Opera-Italian, but it, too,
was useless.</p>

<p>Cartaret had an inspiration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spanish!&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;Does any one know
any Spanish?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pasbeaucoup did; he knew two or three
phrases&mdash;chiefly relating to prices on the menu
of the Deux Colombes&mdash;but to him also the
awful woman only shook her head in ignorance.</p>

<p>Cartaret took up the French again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>82]</a></span>
&ldquo;Can you not tell me what you want here?&rdquo;
he pleaded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kar-kar-tay,&rdquo; said the stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Seraphin, clapping his hands.
&ldquo;Does not Houdon say that she makes her abode
in the same house that you make yours? She
seeks you, monsieur. &lsquo;Kar-kar-tay,&rsquo; it is her
manner of endeavoring to say Cartar<em>ette</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the sound of that name, the stranger
nodded hard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oui, oui!</i>&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>She understood that her chief inquisitor was
Cartaret, and it was indeed Cartaret that she
sought. She flung herself on her knees to him.
When he hurriedly raised her, she caught at
the skirt of his coat and nearly pulled it from
him in an attempt to drag him to the stairs.</p>

<p>Cartaret looked sharply at Houdon. The musician
having been so recently saved from the
wrath of his host, was momentarily discreet:
he hid his smile behind one of the thin bands
that contrasted so sharply with his plump cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>83]</a></span>
&ldquo;Messieurs,&rdquo; said Cartaret, &ldquo;I am going with
this lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They all edged forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I am going alone,&rdquo; added the American.
&ldquo;I wish you good-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will be knifed in the street,&rdquo; said
Madame. Her tone implied: &ldquo;And it will serve
you right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>None of the others seemed to mind his going;
the wrangle over, they were ready for their
coffee and liqueurs. Houdon was frankly relieved.
Only Seraphin protested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you will leave your dinner unfinished?&rdquo;
he cried.</p>

<p>Cartaret was taking his hat and rain-coat
from the row of pegs on the wall where, among
the other guests&rsquo;, he had hung them when he entered.
He nodded his answer to Seraphin&rsquo;s query.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave your dinner?&rdquo; said Seraphin. &ldquo;But
my God, it is paid for!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; said Cartaret, and was plunged
down the stairs by the strangely-garbed woman
tugging at his hand.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="vsmlfont">WHICH TELLS HOW CARTARET RETURNED TO THE
RUE DU VAL-DE-GR&Acirc;CE, AND WHAT HE FOUND
THERE</span></h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La timidit&eacute; est un grand p&eacute;ch&eacute; contre l&rsquo;amour.&mdash;Anatole
France: <i>La Rotisserie de la Reine P&eacute;dauque</i>.</p>
</div>


<p>If that strange old woman in the rakish head-dress
was in a hurry, Cartaret, you may be
sure, was in no mood for tarrying by the way.
He left the Caf&eacute; des Deux Colombes, picturing
The Girl of the Rose desperately ill, and
he was resolved not only to be the first to
come to her aid, but to have none of the restaurant&rsquo;s
suspicious company for a companion.
Then, no sooner had he passed through the
empty room on the ground-floor of Mme. Pasbeaucoup&rsquo;s
establishment and gone a few steps
toward the rue de Seine, than he began to fear
that perhaps the house to which he was apparently
being conducted&mdash;The Girl&rsquo;s house and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>85]</a></span>
his own&mdash;had taken fire; or that the cause of the
duenna&rsquo;s mission was some like misfortune which
would be better remedied, so far as The Girl&rsquo;s
interests were concerned, if there were more
rescuers than one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; he begged his guide
to inform him, as they hurried through the darkened
streets.</p>

<p>His guide lifted both hands to her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is mademoiselle ill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The duenna shook her head in an emphatic
negative.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The place isn&rsquo;t on fire?&rdquo; His tone was one
of petition, as if, should he pray hard enough,
she might avert the catastrophe he now dreaded;
or as if, by touching her sympathies, he could
release some hidden spring of intelligible speech.</p>

<p>The old woman, however, only shook her head
again and hurried on. Cartaret was glad to
find that she possessed an agility impossible for
a city-bred woman of her apparent age, and
he was still more relieved when they reached
their lodging-house and discovered it in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span>
apparently the same condition as that in which he
had left it.</p>

<p>Their ascent of the stairs was like a race&mdash;a
race ending in a dead-heat. At the landing, Cartaret
turned, of course, toward his neighbor&rsquo;s
door; to his amazement, the old woman pulled
him to his own.</p>

<p>He opened it and struck a match: the room
was empty. He held the match until it burnt
his fingers.</p>

<p>The old woman pushed him toward his table,
on which stood a battered lamp. She pointed
to the lamp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But your mistress?&rdquo; asked Cartaret.</p>

<p>The duenna pointed to the lamp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I light it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>He lit the lamp. The flame grew until it
illuminated a small circle about the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now what?&rdquo; Cartaret inquired.</p>

<p>Again that odd gesture toward the nose and
mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Cartaret.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>87]</a></span>
She picked up the lamp and made as if to
search the floor for something. Then she held
out the lamp to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&rdquo;&mdash;it began to dawn on Cartaret&mdash;&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve
lost something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oui, oui!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took the lamp, and they both fell on
their knees. Together they began a minute inspection
of the dusty floor. Cartaret&rsquo;s mind was
more easy now: at least his Lady suffered no
physical distress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a sort of religious ceremony,&rdquo; muttered
the American, as, foot by foot, they crawled
and groped over the grimy boards....</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was it money you lost?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

<p>No, it was not money.</p>

<p>The search continued. Cartaret crawled under
the divan, while the duenna held the cover high
to admit the light. He blackened his hands in
the fire-place and transferred a little of the soot
to his few extra clothes that hung behind the
corner curtain&mdash;but only a little; most of the soot
preferred his hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>88]</a></span>
&ldquo;I never knew before that the room was so
large,&rdquo; he gasped.</p>

<p>They had covered two-thirds of the floor-space
when a new thought struck him. Still
crouching on his knees, he once more tried his
companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find it,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d give a good
deal to know what I&rsquo;m looking for. What were
you doing in here when you lost it, anyway?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head, with her hand on her
breast. Then she pointed to the door and
nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean your mistress lost it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oui.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, let&rsquo;s get her. She can tell me
what I&rsquo;m after.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He half rose; but the woman seized his arm.
She broke into loud sounds, patently protestations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Cartaret. &ldquo;Why not? Come
on; I&rsquo;ll knock at her door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The duenna would not have her mistress disturbed.
The ancient voice rose to a shriek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>89]</a></span>
&ldquo;But I say yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The shriek grew louder. With amazing
strength, the old woman forced his unsuspecting
body back to its former position; she came near
to jolting the lamp from his hand.</p>

<p>It was then that Cartaret heard a lesser noise
behind them: a voice, the low sweet voice of
The Rose-Lady, asked, in the duenna&rsquo;s strange
tongue, a question from the doorway. Cartaret
turned his head.</p>

<p>She was standing there in the dim light, a
sort of kimono gathered about her, her sandaled
feet peeping from its lower folds, the lovely
arm that held the curious dressing-gown in place
bare to the elbow. She was smiling at the
answer that her guardian had already given her;
Cartaret thought her even more beautiful than
when he had seen her before.</p>

<p>The duenna had scuttled forward on her knees
and, amid a series of cries, was pressing the hem
of the kimono to her lips. The Girl&rsquo;s free hand
was raising the petitioner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>90]</a></span>
&ldquo;I am sorry that you have been disturbed by
Chitta,&rdquo; she was saying.</p>

<p>Cartaret understood then that he was addressed.
Moreover, he became conscious that he
was by no means at his best on his knees, with
his clothes even more rumpled than usual, his
hands black and, probably, his face no better.
He scrambled to his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been no trouble,&rdquo; he said awkwardly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say that it had been a good deal,&rdquo;
said the Girl. &ldquo;Chitta is so very superstitious.
Did you find it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Cartaret. &ldquo;At least I don&rsquo;t think
so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Girl puckered her pretty brow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; explained Cartaret, coming nearer,
but thankful that he had left the lamp on the
floor behind him, whence its light would least
reveal his soiled hands and face&mdash;&ldquo;I mean that
I haven&rsquo;t the least idea what I was looking
for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Girl burst into rippling laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not the least,&rdquo; pursued the emboldened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>91]</a></span>
American. &ldquo;You see, I left word with Refrogn&eacute;&mdash;that&rsquo;s
the concierge&mdash;that I was dining
with some friends at the Deux Colombes&mdash;that&rsquo;s
a caf&eacute;&mdash;when I went out; and I suppose she&mdash;I
mean your&mdash;your maid, isn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;made him
understand that she&mdash;I mean your maid again&mdash;wanted
me&mdash;you know, I don&rsquo;t generally leave
word; but this time I thought that perhaps you&mdash;I
mean she&mdash;or, anyhow, I had an idea&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He knew that he was making a fool of himself,
so he was glad when she came serenely to
his assistance and gallantly shifted the difficulty
to her own shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was too bad of Chitta to take you away
from your dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chitta had slunk into the shadows, but Cartaret
could descry her glaring at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was of no consequence,&rdquo; he said; he
had forgotten what the dinner cost him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, sir, for a reason of so great an absurdity!&rdquo;
She put one hand on the table and
leaned on it. &ldquo;I must tell you that there is
in my country a superstition&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>92]</a></span>
She hesitated. Cartaret, his heart leaping,
leaned forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is your country, mademoiselle?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>She did not seem to hear that. She went on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is really a superstition so much absurd
that I am slow to speak to you of it. They
believe, our peasants, that it brings good luck
when they take it with them across our borders;
that only it can ensure their return, and that,
if it is lost, they will never come back to their
home-land.&rdquo; Her blue eyes met his gaze. &ldquo;They,
sir, love their home-land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret was certain that the land which could
produce this presence, at once so human and so
spiritual, was well worth loving. He wanted to
say so, but another glance at her serene face
checked any impulse that might seem impertinent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, too, love my country, although I am not
superstitious,&rdquo; the Girl pursued, &ldquo;so I had brought
it with me from my country. I brought it with
me to Paris, and I lost it. We go early to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>93]</a></span>
sleep, the people of my race; I had not missed
it when I went to bed; but then Chitta missed
it; and I told her that I thought that I had
perhaps dropped it here. She ran before I
could recall her&mdash;and I fell straightway asleep.
She tells me that she had seen you go out, sir,
and that she went to the concierge, as you supposed,
to discover where you had gone, for she
thought, she says, that your door was locked.&rdquo;
The corners of the Girl&rsquo;s mouth quivered in a
smile. &ldquo;I trust that she would not have trespassed
when you were gone, even if your door
<em>was</em> open. Until I heard her shriek but now, I
had no idea that she would pursue you. I regret
for your sake that she disturbed you, but I
also regret for her sake that it was not found.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret had guessed the answer to his question
before he asked it. His cheeks burned for
the consequences, but he put the query:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was lost?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I thought that I had said it: a flower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A&mdash;a rose?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>94]</a></span>
The hand that held her kimono pressed a little
closer to her breast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you have found it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mountain-peaks and glaciers in the sun: Cartaret,
being a practical man, was distinctly
aware of not wanting her to know the present
whereabouts of that flower. He fenced for time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was it a rose?&rdquo; he repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the Azure Rose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Perhaps, after all, he was wrong.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard of a blue rose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not blue,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;we call it the
azure rose as you, sir, would say the rose of
azure, or the rose of heaven. We call it the
azure rose because it grows only in our own
land, where the mountains are blue, and only
high, high up on those mountains, near to the
blue of the sky. It is a white rose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Of course,&rdquo; said Cartaret. &ldquo;A white
rose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stood uncertainly before her. For a reason
that he would have hesitated long to define,
he hated to part with that rose; for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>95]</a></span>
reason concerning which he was quite clear, he
did not want to produce it there and then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have it?&rdquo; asked The Girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Er&mdash;do you want it?&rdquo; countered Cartaret.</p>

<p>A shade of impatience crossed her face. She
tried to master it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I gather from your speech that you, sir, are
American, not English. You are the first American
that ever I have met, and I do not seem well
to understand the motives of all that you say,
although I do understand perfectly the words.
You ask do I want this rose. But of course I
want it! Have I not asked for it? I want it
because Chitta will be distressed if we lose it,
but also I want it for myself, to whom it belongs,
since it is a souvenir already dear to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her face was alight. Cartaret looked at it;
then his glance fell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to
offend you. I&rsquo;m forever putting my foot in
things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have trodden on my rose?&rdquo; Her voice
discovered her dismay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span>
&ldquo;No, no! I wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t. I meant
that I was always making mistakes. This afternoon,
for instance&mdash;And now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>To the rescue of his embarrassment came the
thought that indeed he obviously could not tread
on the rose, unless he were a contortionist, because
the rose was&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Among the smudges of black, his cheeks
burned a hot red. He thrust a hand between
his shirt and waistcoat and produced the coveted
flower: a snow-rose in the center of his grimy
palm.</p>

<p>Again the perfume, subtle, haunting. Again
the pure mountain-peaks. Again the music of
a poem in a tongue unknown....</p>

<p>At first he did not dare to look at her; he
kept his gaze lowered. Had he looked, he would
have seen her wide eyes startle, then change to
amusement, and then to a doubting tenderness.
He felt her delicate fingers touch his palm and
he thrilled at the touch as she recaptured her
rose. He did not see that, in welcome to the
returned prodigal, she started to raise to her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>97]</a></span>
own lips those petals, gathered so tight against
the flower&rsquo;s heart, which he had lately kissed.
When at last he glanced up, she had recovered
her poise and was again looking like some
sculptured Artemis that had wandered into his
lonely room from the gardens of the Luxembourg.</p>

<p>Then he saw a much more prosaic thing. He
saw the hand that held the rose and saw it
discolored.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you ever forgive me?&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been leaning on my table, and I mix
my paints on it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The speech was not precisely pellucid, but she
followed his eyes to the hand and understood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fault was mine,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Cartaret was searching among the tubes and
bottles on the table. He searched so nervously
that he knocked some of them to the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll just wait a minute.&rdquo; He found
the bottle he wanted. &ldquo;And if you don&rsquo;t mind
the turpentine.... It smells terribly, but
it will evaporate soon, and it cleans you up
before you know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>98]</a></span>
He lifted one of the rags that lay about, and
then another. He discarded both as much too
soiled, hesitated, ran to the curtained corner
and returned with a clean towel.</p>

<p>She had hidden the flower. She extended her
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mind?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I object? No. You are kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took the smudged hand&mdash;took it with a
hand that trembled&mdash;and bent his smudged face
so close to it that she must have felt his breath
beating on it, hot and quick. He made two
dabs with the end of the towel.</p>

<p>Chitta, whom they had both sadly neglected,
pounced upon them from her lair among the
shadows. She seized the hand and, jabbering
fifty words in the time for two, pushed Cartaret
from his work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to hurt anybody,&rdquo; said Cartaret.
&ldquo;Do, please, get away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Girl laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chitta trusts no foreigners,&rdquo; she explained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>99]</a></span>
She spoke to Chitta, but Chitta, glowering at
Cartaret, shook her head and grumbled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not any more desire to order her about,&rdquo;
said The Girl to Cartaret. &ldquo;Already this evening
I have wounded her feelings, I fear. She
says she will allow none but herself to minister
to me. You, sir, will forgive her? After all,
it is her duty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret inwardly cursed Chitta&rsquo;s fidelity.
What he said was: &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; He knew that
just here he might say something gallant, and
that he would think of that something an hour
hence; but he could not think of it now.</p>

<p>The Girl touched the turpentine bottle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And may we take it to our room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh? Oh, certainly,&rdquo; said Cartaret.</p>

<p>She held out her hand, the palm lowered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Cartaret&rsquo;s heart bounded: this time she had
not said &ldquo;Good-by.&rdquo; He seized the hand.
Chitta growled, and he released it with a conventional
handshake.</p>

<p>The Girl smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>100]</a></span>
&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;this afternoon it puzzled
me, but now I recollect: you Americans, sir,
shake one&rsquo;s hand, do you not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was gone, and glowering Chitta with her,
before he could answer.</p>

<p>Cartaret stood where she had left him, his
brows knitted. He heard Chitta double-lock
the door to their rooms. He was thinking
thoughts that his brain was not accustomed to.
It was some time before they became more familiar.
Then he gasped:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if my face is dirty!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took the lamp and sought the sole mirror
that his room boasted. His face was dirty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn!&rdquo; said Cartaret.</p>

<p>Down in the narrow street, an uncertain chorus
was singing:</p>

<div class="cpoem2">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing, friend, &rsquo;twixt you and me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Except the best of company.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">(There&rsquo;s just one bock &rsquo;twixt you and me,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">and I&rsquo;ll catch up full soon!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What woman&rsquo;s lips compare to this:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This sturdy seidel&rsquo;s frothy kiss&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>101]</a></span>
His guests were coming to seek him. They
had remembered him at last.</p>

<p>Cartaret&rsquo;s mind, however, was busy with other
matters. He had not thought of the gallant
thing that he might have said to The Girl, but
he had thought of something equally surprising.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee whiz!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I understand now&mdash;it&rsquo;s
probably the custom of her country: she
expected me to kiss her hand. Kiss her hand&mdash;and
I missed the chance!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret did not see the Lady of the Rose next
day, though his work suffered sadly through the
worker&rsquo;s jumping from before his easel at the
slightest sound on the landing, running to his
door, and sometimes himself going to the hall
and standing there for many minutes, trying,
and not succeeding, to look as if he had just
come in, or were just going out, on business of
the first importance. He concluded, for the
hundredth time, that he was a fool; but he persevered
in his folly. He asked himself why
he should feel such an odd interest in an unknown
girl practically alone in Paris; but he
found no satisfactory answer. He declared that
it was madness in him to suppose that she could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>103]</a></span>
want ever to see him again, and madness to
suppose that a penniless failure had anything to
gain by seeing her; but he continued to try.</p>

<p>On the night following the first day of his
watch, Cartaret went to bed disappointed and
slept heavily. On the second night he went to
bed worried, and dreamed of scaling a terrible
mountain in quest of a flower, and of falling
into a hideous chasm just as the flower turned
into a beautiful woman and smiled at him. On
the third night, he surrendered to acute alarm
and believed that he did not sleep at all.</p>

<p>The morning of the fourth day found him
knocking on the panel of that magic door opposite.
Chitta opened the door a crack, growled,
and shut it in his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; reflected Cartaret, &ldquo;what would
be the best means of killing this old woman. I
wonder if the hyena would eat candy sent her
by mail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had been watching, all the previous day,
for the Lady of the Rose to go out, and she
did not leave her room. Now it occurred to him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>104]</a></span>
to watch for Chitta&rsquo;s exit on a forage foray and
to renew his attack during her absence. This he
accomplished. From a front window, he had no
sooner seen the duenna swing into the rue du
Val de Gr&acirc;ce, with her head-dress bobbing and
a shopping-net on her arm, than he was again
knocking at the door across the landing.</p>

<p>He knew now, did Cartaret, that, on whatever
landing of life he had lived, there was always
that door opposite, the handle of which he had
never dared to turn, the key to which he had
never yet found. He knew, on this morning&mdash;a
clear, windy morning, for March had come in
like a lion&mdash;that, for the door of every heart in
the world, or high or low, or cruel or tender,
there is a heart opposite with a door not inaccessible.</p>

<p>The pale yellow sun sang of it: Marvelous
Door Opposite!&mdash;it seemed to sing&mdash;how, when
they pass that portal, the commonplace becomes
the unusual and reality is turned into romance.
Lead becomes silver then, and copper&mdash;gold.
Magical Door Opposite! All the possibilities of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>105]</a></span>
life&mdash;aye, and what is better, all life&rsquo;s impossibilities&mdash;are
behind you, and all life&rsquo;s fears
and hopes before. All our young dreams, our
mature ambitions, our old regrets, curl in incense
from our brains and struggle to pass that keyhole.
Unhappy he for whom the door never
opens; more unhappy, often, he for whom it does
open; but most unhappy he who never sees that
it is there: the Door across the Landing.</p>

<p>Cartaret knocked as if he were knocking at the
gate of Paradise, and, perhaps again as if he were
knocking at the gate of Paradise, he got no answer.
He knocked a second time and heard the
rustle of a woman&rsquo;s skirt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo;&mdash;She spoke in French now,
but he would have known her voice had she
talked the language of Grand Street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cartaret,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

<p>She opened the door. A ray of light beat its
way through a grimy window in the hall to welcome
her&mdash;Cartaret was sure that no light had
passed that window for years and years&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>106]</a></span>
rested on the beauty of her pure face, her calm
eyes, her blue-black hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; said the Lady of the Rose.</p>

<p>It sounded wonderful to him. When <em>he</em> replied
&ldquo;Good morning&rdquo;&mdash;and could think of
nothing else to say&mdash;the phrase sounded less remarkable.</p>

<p>She waited a moment. She looked a little
doubtful. She said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You perhaps wanted Chitta?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Were her eyes laughing? Her lips were serious,
but he was uncertain of her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you wanted me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said Cartaret, and blushed at the vehemence
of the monosyllable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For what, indeed, had he come there? He
vividly realized that he should have prepared
some excuse; but, having prepared none, he could
offer only the truth&mdash;or so much of it as seemed
expedient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>107]</a></span>
&ldquo;I wanted to see if you were all right,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But certainly,&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;I thank you,
sir; but, yes, I am&mdash;all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She said no more; Cartaret felt as if he could
never speak again. However, speak he must.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t seen
you anywhere about, and I was rather worried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chitta takes of me the best care.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but, you see, I didn&rsquo;t know and I&mdash;Oh,
yes: I wanted to see whether that turpentine
worked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The turpentine!&rdquo; All suspicion of amusement
fled her eyes: she was contrite. &ldquo;I comprehend.
How careless of Chitta not at once
to have returned it to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turpentine! What a nectar for romance!
Cartaret made a face that could not have been
worse had he swallowed some of the liquid. He
tried to protest, but she did not heed him. Instead,
she left him standing there while she
went to hunt for that accursed bottle. In five
minutes she had found it, returned it, thanked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>108]</a></span>
him and sent him back to his own room, no
further advanced in her acquaintance than when
he knocked at her door.</p>

<p>She had laughed at him. He returned fiercely
to his work, convinced that she had been laughing
at him all the while. Very well: what did
he care? He would forget her.</p>

<p>He concentrated all his thoughts upon the
idea of forgetting the Lady of the Rose. In
order to assist his purpose, he set a new canvas
on his easel and fell to work to make a portrait
of her as she should be and was not. The contrast
would help him, and the plan was cheap,
because it needed no model. By the next afternoon
he had completed the portrait of a beautiful
woman with a white rose at her throat. It
was quite his best piece of work, and an excellent
likeness of the girl in the room opposite.</p>

<p>He saw that it was a likeness and thought of
painting it out, but it would be a pity to destroy
his best work, so he merely put it aside. He
decided to paint a purely imaginative figure.
He squeezed out some paints, almost at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>109]</a></span>
haphazard, and began painting in that mood. After
forty-eight hours of this sort of thing, he had
produced another picture of the same woman in
another pose.</p>

<p>In more ways than one, Cartaret&rsquo;s position
was growing desperate. His money was almost
gone. He must paint something that Fourget,
or some equally kind-hearted dealer, would buy,
and these two portraits he would not offer for
sale.</p>

<p>Telling himself that it was only to end his
obsession, he tried twice again to see the Lady
of the Rose, who was now going out daily to
some master&rsquo;s class, and each time he gained
nothing by his attempt. First, she would not
answer his knock, though he could hear her moving
about and knew that she must have heard
him crossing the hall from his own room and
be aware of her caller&rsquo;s identity. On the next
occasion, he waited for her at the corner of the
Boul&rsquo; Miche&rsquo; when he knew that she would be
returning from the class, and was greeted by
nothing save a formal bow. So he had to force
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>110]</a></span>
himself to pot-boilers by sheer determination, and
finally turned out something that then seemed
poor enough for Fourget to like.</p>

<p>Houdon came in and found him putting on
the finishing touches. The plump musician,
frightened by his impudence, had stopped below
at his own room on the night of the dinner
when the revelers at last came to seek their host.
Now it appeared that he was anxious to apologize.
He advanced with the dignity befitting
a monarch kindly disposed, and his gesturing
hands beat the score of the kettle-drums for the
march of the priests in <i>A&iuml;da</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My very dear Cartarette!&rdquo; cried Houdon.
&ldquo;Ah, but it is good again to see you! I so
regretted myself not to ascend with our friends
to call upon you the evening of our little collation.&rdquo;
He sought to dismiss the subject with
a run on the invisible piano and the words: &ldquo;But
I was slightly indisposed: without doubt our
good comrades informed you that I was slightly
indisposed. I am very sensitive, and these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>111]</a></span>
communions of high thought are too much for my
delicate nerves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His good comrades had told Cartaret that
Houdon was very drunk; but Cartaret decided
that to continue his quarrel would be an insult
to its cause. After all, he reflected, this was
Houdon&rsquo;s conception of an apology. Cartaret
looked at the composer, who was a walking
symbol of good feeding and iron nerves, and
replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother to mention it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Houdon seized both of Cartaret&rsquo;s hands and
pressed them fondly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said Houdon magnanimously,
&ldquo;we shall permit ourselves to say no more about
it. What sings your sublime poet, Henri
Wadsworth Longchap? &lsquo;I shall allow the decomposed
past to bury her dead.&rsquo;&mdash;Or do I mistake:
was it Whitman, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hein</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gestured his way to Cartaret&rsquo;s easel, much
as if the air were water and he were swimming
there. He praised extravagantly the picture that
Cartaret now knew to be bad. Finally he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>112]</a></span>
began to potter about the room with a pretense
of admiring the place and looking at its other
canvases, but all the while conveying the feeling
that he was apprising the financial status
of its occupant. Cartaret saw him drawing
nearer and nearer to the two canvases that,
their faces toward the wall, bore the likeness
of the Lady of the Rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am just going out,&rdquo; said Cartaret. He
hurried to his visitor and took the fellow&rsquo;s arm.
&ldquo;I must take that picture on the easel to the
rue St. Andr&eacute; des Arts. Will you come along?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Houdon seemed suspicious of this sudden
friendliness. He cast a curious glance at the
canvases he had been about to examine, but
his choice was obviously Hobson&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gladly,&rdquo; he flourished. &ldquo;To my <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cher ami</i>
Fourget, is it? But I know him well. Perhaps
my influence may assist you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Cartaret. He doubted it, but
he hoped that something would assist him.</p>

<p>He held the picture, still wet of course, exposed
for all the world of the Quarter to see,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>113]</a></span>
hurried Houdon past the landing and could
have sworn that the composer&rsquo;s eyes lingered
at the sacred door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is an infamy,&rdquo; said Houdon, when
they had walked as far down the Boul&rsquo; Miche&rsquo;
as the Mus&eacute;e Cluny&mdash;&ldquo;it is an infamy to sell
at once such a superb work to such a little cow
of a dealer. Why then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I must,&rdquo; said Cartaret.</p>

<p>Houdon laughed and wagged his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;you deceive others: not
Houdon. I know well the disguised prince.
Come&rdquo;&mdash;he looked up and down the Boulevard
St. Germain before he ventured to cross it&mdash;&ldquo;trust
your friend Houdon, my dear Cartarette.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am quite honest with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bah! Have your own way, then. Pursue
your fancy of self-support for a time. It is
noble, that. But think not that I am deceived.
Me, Houdon: I know. Name of an oil-well,
you should send this masterpiece to the Salon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But just at the corner of the rue St. Andr&eacute;
des Arts, the great composer thought that he saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>114]</a></span>
ahead of him a friend with whom he had a pressing
engagement of five minutes. He excused
himself with such a wealth of detail that Cartaret
was convinced of the slightness of the
Fourget acquaintanceship, which Houdon had
not again referred to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be finished and waiting at this corner
long ere you return,&rdquo; vowed Houdon. &ldquo;Go,
my friend, and if that little dealer pays you
one third of what your picture is worth, my
faith, he will bankrupt himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Cartaret went on alone, and was presently
glad that he was unaccompanied.</p>

<p>For Fourget would not buy the picture. It
was a silly sketch of a pretty boy pulling to
tatters the petals of a rose, and the gray-haired
dealer, although he had kindly eyes under his
bristling eyebrows, behind his glistening spectacles,
shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he said: so many of these hopeful
young fellows brought him their loved work,
and he had so often, but never untruthfully, to
say that he was sorry. &ldquo;I am very sorry, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>115]</a></span>
this is not the real you, monsieur. The values&mdash;you
know better than that. The composition&mdash;it
is unworthy of you, M. Cartarette.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret was in no mood to try elsewhere. He
wanted to fling the thing into the Seine. He
certainly did not want Houdon to see him return
with it. Might he leave it with Fourget? Perhaps
some customer might see and care for it?</p>

<p>No, Fourget had his reputation to sustain; but
there was that rascal Lepoittevin across the
street&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Cartaret went to the rascal, a most amiable
man, who would buy no more than would
Fourget. He was willing, however, to have the
picture left there on the bare chance of picking
up a sale&mdash;and a commission&mdash;and there Cartaret
left it.</p>

<p>Houdon wormed the truth out of him as
easily as if Cartaret had come back carrying
the picture under his arm: the young American
was too disconsolate to hide his chagrin. Houdon
was at first incredulous and then overcome; he
asked his dear friend to purchase brandy for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>116]</a></span>
two of them at the Caf&eacute; Pantheon: such treatment
of a veritable masterpiece was too much
for his sensitive nerves.</p>

<p>With some difficulty, Cartaret got rid of the
composer. On a bench in the Luxembourg
Gardens, he took account of his resources. They
were shockingly slender and, if they were to last
him any time at all, he must exercise the most
stringent economy. He must buy no more
brandy for musical geniuses. Indeed, he must
buy no more caf&eacute; dinners for himself....</p>

<p>It struck him, as a happy thought, that he
might save a little if he lived on such cold
solids as he could buy at the fruit-stand and
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">p&acirc;tisseries</i> and such liquids as he might warm in
a tin-cup over his lamp. Better men than he
was had lived thus in the Quarter, and Cartaret,
as the thought took shape, rather enjoyed the
prospect: it made him feel as if he were another
martyr to Art, or as if&mdash;though he was not
clear as to the logic of this&mdash;he were another
martyr to Love. He considered going to P&egrave;re
la Chaise and putting violets on the tomb of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>117]</a></span>
H&eacute;loise and Abelard; but he decided that he
could not afford the tram-fare, and he was already
too tired to walk, so he made his scanty
purchases instead, and had rather a good time
doing it.</p>

<p>He passed Chitta on his way up the stairs to
his room, with his arms full of edibles, and he
thought that she frowned disapproval. He supposed
she would tell her mistress scornfully, and
he hoped that her mistress would understand
and pity him.</p>

<p>He got a board and nailed it to the sill of
one of the rear windows. On that he stored
his food and, contemplating it, felt like a successful
housekeeper.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
<br />
<span class="vsmlfont">OF DOMESTIC ECONOMY, OF DAY-DREAMS, AND
OF A FAR COUNTRY AND ITS SOVEREIGN LADY</span></h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L&rsquo;indiscr&eacute;tion d&rsquo;un de ces amis officieux qui ne sauraient
garder in&eacute;dite la nouvelle susceptible de vous causer un
chagrin.&mdash;Murger: <i>Sc&egrave;nes de la Vie de Boh&egrave;me</i>.</p>
</div>


<p>You would have said that it behooved a man
in Charlie Cartaret&rsquo;s situation to devote his evenings
to a consideration of its difficulties and his
days to hard work; but Cartaret, though he did,
as you will see, try to work, devoted the first
evening of his new r&eacute;gime to thoughts that, if
they affected his situation at all, tended only
to complicate it. He thought, as he had so much
of late, and as he was to think so much more
in the future, of the Lady of the Rose.</p>

<p>Who was she? Whence did she come? What
was this native land of hers that she professed
to love so well? And, if she did love it so well,
why had she left it and come to Paris with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>119]</a></span>
companion that appeared to be some strange
compromise between guardian and servant?</p>

<p>He wondered if she were some revolutionary
exile: Paris was always full of revolutionary
exiles. He wondered if she were a rightful
heiress, dispossessed of a foreign title. Perhaps
she was the lovely pretender to a throne. In
that mysterious home of hers, she must have
possessed some exalted position, or the right to
it, for Chitta had kneeled to her on the dusty
floor of this studio, and the Lady&rsquo;s manner, he
now recalled, was the manner of one accustomed
to command. Her beauty was of a type
that he had read of as Irish&mdash;the beauty of fair
skin, hair black and eyes of deepest blue; but
the speech was the English of a woman born
to another tongue.</p>

<p>What was her native speech? Both her French
and her English were innocent of alien accent&mdash;he
had heard at least a phrase or two of the
former&mdash;yet both had a precision that betrayed
them as not her own and both had a foreign-born
construction. Her frequent use of the word
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>120]</a></span>
&ldquo;sir&rdquo; in addressing him was sufficiently peculiar.
She employed the word not as one that speaks
frequently to a superior, but rather as if she
were used to it in a formal language, or a grade
of life, in which it was a common courtesy. It
was something more usual than the French
&ldquo;monsieur,&rdquo; even more usual than the Spanish
&ldquo;se&ntilde;or.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret leaned from a window. The air was
still keen, but the night was clear. The rue du
Val de Gr&acirc;ce was deserted, its houses dark and
silent. Overhead, in the narrow ribbon of indigo
sky, hung a pallid moon: a disk of yellow glass.</p>

<p>What indeed was she, this Lady of the
Rose? He pictured as hers a distant country
of deep valleys full of clamoring streams and
high mountains where white roses grew. He pictured
her as that country&rsquo;s sovereign. Yet the
rose which she treasured had not yet faded on
the day of her arrival: she could not come from
anywhere so far away.</p>

<p>He was cold. He closed the window, shivering.
He was ridiculous: why, he had been in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>121]</a></span>
danger of falling in love with a woman of whom
he knew nothing! He did not even know her
name....</p>


<p class="break">The passage of slow-footed time helped him,
however, not at all. He would sit for hours,
idle before his easel, listening for her light step
on the stair and afraid to go to meet her when
at last he heard it, for he was desperately poor
now, and poverty was making him the coward
that it will sooner or later make any man.</p>

<p>He had antagonized the concierge by preparing
his own coffee in the morning instead of
continuing to pay Mme. Refrogn&eacute; for it. When
he had something to cook, he cooked badly; but
there were days when he had nothing, and lived
on pastry and bricks of chocolate, and others
when it seemed to him that such supplies as he
could buy and store on that shelf outside the
window were oddly short-lived.</p>

<p>For a while he called daily at the shop of M.
Lepoittevin, but that absurd picture of a boy
tearing a rose would not sell, and Cartaret soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>122]</a></span>
grew ashamed of calling there; Fourget he would
not face. He managed at first to dispose of one
or two sketches and so kept barely alive, yet, as
the days went by, his luck dwindled and his
greatest energy was expended in keeping up a
proud pretense of comfort to his friends of the
Quarter.</p>

<p>Pear-shaped Devignes was easy to deceive: the
opera-singer lived too well to want to believe
that anybody in the world could starve. Garnier,
the cadaverous poet, saved trouble, indulging
his dislike of other people&rsquo;s poverty by remaining
away from it; but Seraphin, who came
often and sat about the studio in a silence wholly
uncharacteristic, was difficult. Houdon, finally,
was frequent and expensive: he always foraged
about what he called Cartaret&rsquo;s &ldquo;tempting window-buffet,&rdquo;
but he regarded the condition of
affairs as the passing foible of a young man
temporarily wearied by the pleasures of wealth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he snorted one day when he had come
in with Varachon, &ldquo;you fail wholly to deceive
me, Cartarette. You say you are not well-to-do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>123]</a></span>
so that we shall think that you are not, but I
know, I! Had you not your own income, you
would try to sell more pictures, and your pictures
are superb. They would fetch a pretty sum.
Believe not that because I have a great musical
genius I have no eye for painting. I know good
painting. All Arts are one, my brother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He jabbed Cartaret&rsquo;s empty stomach and,
whistling a theme and twisting his little mustache,
went to the window and took a huge
bite of the last apple there.</p>

<p>Cartaret watched the composer toss half the
apple into the concierge&rsquo;s garden.</p>

<p>Varachon, the sculptor, grunted through his
broken nose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your work is bad,&rdquo; he whispered to Cartaret&mdash;&ldquo;very
bad. You require a long rest. Go
to Nice for a month.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The weeks passed. Cartaret was underfed
and discouraged. He was too discouraged now
to attempt to renew his acquaintance with the
Lady of the Rose. He was pale and thin, and
this from reasons wholly physical.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>124]</a></span>
Meanwhile, through the scented dawns, April
was coming up to that city in which April is
most beautiful and most seductive. From the
spicy Mediterranean coasts, along the Valley of
the Rhone, Love was dancing upon Paris with
laughing Spring for his partner. Already the
trees had blossomed between the Place de La
Concorde and the Rond Point, and out in the
Bois the birds were singing to their mates.</p>

<p>One morning, when Cartaret, with unsteady
hand, drew back his curtain, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rouge-gorges</i> were
calling from the concierge&rsquo;s garden, and seemed
to be calling to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seize hold of love!&rdquo; they chorused in that
garden. &ldquo;Life is short; time flies, and love flies
with it. Love will pass you by. Take it, take
it, take it, while there still is time! Like us, it
is a bird that flies, but, unlike us, it never more returns.
It is a rose that withers&mdash;a white rose: take
it while it blooms. Take it, though it leave you
soon; take it, though it scratch your fingers. Take
it, take it, take it now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>On that day the annual siege of Paris ended,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>125]</a></span>
the city fell before her invaders, and by the time
that Cartaret went into the streets, the army of
occupation was in possession. The Luxembourg
Gardens, the very benches along the Boul&rsquo; Miche&rsquo;
were full of lovers: he could not stir from the
house without encountering them.</p>

<p>From it, however, he had to go: the Spring
called him with a sad seductiveness that he could
no longer resist. He wandered aimlessly, trying
the impossible: trying to keep his eyes from the
couples that also wandered, but wandered hand
in hand, and trying to keep his thoughts from
roses and the Lady of the Rose.</p>

<p>He found himself before one of the riverside
bookstalls, fingering an old book, leather-bound.
The text, he realized, was English, or what once
was so: it was a volume of Maundeville, and
Cartaret was reading:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Betwene the cytee and the chirche of Bethlehem
is the felde Floridus; that is to seyne, the
field florsched. For als moche as a fayre mayden
was blamed with wrong ... for whiche
cause sche was demed to the dethe, and to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>126]</a></span>
brent in that place, to the which she was ladd.
And, as the fyre began to brenne about hire,
she made her preyeres to oure Lord, that als
wissely as sche was not gylty ... that he
would help hire, and make it to be knowen to
alle men of his mercyfulle grace. And, whanne
sche had thus seyd, sche entered into the fuyer;
and anon was the fuyer quenched and oute, and
the brondes that weren brennynge becomen white
roseres, full of roses; and theise werein the first
roseres and roses, both white and rede, that ever
ony man saughe. And thus was this mayden
saved by the grace of God.&rdquo; ...</p>

<p>All that week&mdash;while the contents of his window-sideboard
dwindled, he was sure, faster than
he ate from it&mdash;he had tried to forget everything
by painting heavily at pot-boilers. He had
begun with the aim of earning enough to resume
his studies; he had continued with the hope of
getting together enough to keep alive&mdash;in Paris.
And yet, fleeing from that bookstall, he was
fool enough to walk all the way to Les Halles,
to walk into Les Halles, and to stop, fascinated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>127]</a></span>
by a counter laden with boxes of strawberries,
odorous and red, the smallest box of which was
beyond the limits of his economy.</p>

<p>That was bad enough&mdash;it was absurd that his
will should voluntarily play the Barmecide for
the torture of his unrewarded Shacabac of a
stomach&mdash;but worse, without fault of his own,
was yet to follow this mere aggravation of his
baser appetites. Spring and Paris are an irresistible
combination on the side of folly, and
that evening another sign of them presented
itself: there was a burst of music; a hurdy-gurdy
was playing in the rue du Val de Gr&acirc;ce, and
Cartaret, from his window, listened eagerly. It
has been intimated from the best of sources that
all love lives on music, and it is the common
experience that when any love cannot get the
best music, it takes what it can get:</p>

</div>

<p>That French hurdy-gurdy was playing &ldquo;Annie
Laurie,&rdquo; and, since the lonely artist&rsquo;s heart ached
to hear the old, familiar melody, when the
bearded grinder looked aloft, Cartaret drew a
coin from his pocket. Anxious to pay for his
pain, as the human kind always is, he tossed
his last franc to that vendor of emotions in the
twilit street.</p>

<p>He was drunk at last with the wine that his
own misery distilled. He abandoned himself to
the admission that he was in love: he abandoned
himself to his dream of the Lady of the Rose.</p>

<p>Seraphin, in a wonderful new suit of clothes,
found him thus the next morning&mdash;it was a
Friday&mdash;and found him accordingly resentful of
intrusion. Cartaret was sitting before an empty
easel, his hands clasped in his lap, his eyes looking
vacantly through the posts of the easel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day,&rdquo; said Seraphin.</p>

<p>Cartaret said &ldquo;Good-day&rdquo; as if it were a form
of insult.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>129]</a></span>
Seraphin&rsquo;s hands tugged at his two wisps of
whisker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not well, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hein</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was never better in my life,&rdquo; snapped Cartaret,
turning upon his friend a face that was
peaked and drawn.</p>

<p>The Frenchman came timidly nearer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have completed my
<i>magnum opus</i>. It has not sold quite so well as I
hoped, not of course one thousandth of its value.
That is this Spanish cow of a world. But I have
three hundred francs. If you need&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go away,&rdquo; said Cartaret, looking at his
empty easel. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see I&rsquo;m trying to begin
work?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seraphin himself had suffered. His dignity
was not offended: he kept it for only his creditors
and other foes. He guessed that Cartaret was
at last penniless, and he guessed rightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, my friend,&rdquo; he began; &ldquo;none shall
know. Will you not be so kind as to let me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret got up and, for all his weakness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>130]</a></span>
gripped the Frenchman&rsquo;s hand until Dieudonn&eacute;
nearly screamed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a beast, Seraphin!&rdquo; said Cartaret. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
a beast to treat a friendly offer this way. Forgive
me. It&rsquo;s just that I feel a bit rocky this
morning. I drank too much champagne last
night. I do thank you, Seraphin. You&rsquo;re a
good fellow, the best of the lot, and a sight
better than I am. But I&rsquo;m not hard up; really
I&rsquo;m not. I&rsquo;m poor, but I&rsquo;m not a sou poorer
than I was this time last year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a magnificent lie. Seraphin could only
shrug, pretend to believe it, and go away.</p>

<p>Cartaret scarcely heeded the departure. He
had relapsed into his day-dream. He took from
against the wall the two portraits that he had
painted of the Lady of the Rose and hung them,
now here, now there, trying them in various
lights. There were at least ten more sketches
of her by this time, and these, too, he hung in
first one light and then another. He studied
them and tried to be critical, and forgot to be.</p>

<p>His thoughts of her never took the shape of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>131]</a></span>
conscious words&mdash;he loved her too much to attempt
to praise her&mdash;but, as he looked at his
endeavors to portray her, his mind was busy
with his memories of all that loveliness&mdash;and
passed from memories to day-dreams. He saw
her as something that might fade before his
touch. He saw her as a Princess, incognito,
learning his plight, buying his pictures secretly,
and, when she came to her throne, letting him
serve her and worship from afar. And then he
saw her even as a Galatea possible of miraculous
awakening. Why not? Her eyes were the clear
eyes of a woman that has never yet loved, but
they were also, he felt, the eyes of one of those
rare women who, when they love once, love forever.
Cartaret dared, in his thoughts, to lift
the heavy plaits of her blue-black hair and, with
trembling fingers, again to touch that hand at
the recollection of touching which his own hand
tingled.</p>

<p>Why not, indeed? Already a stranger thing
had happened in his meeting her. Until that
year he had not guessed at her existence; oceans
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>132]</a></span>
divided them; the barriers of alien race and
alien speech were raised high between them, and
all of these things had been in vain. The existence
was revealed, the ocean was crossed, the
bar of sundering speech was down. He was
here, close beside her, as if every event of his
life had been intended to bring him. Through
blind ways and up ascents misunderstood, unattracted
by the many and lonely among the
crowd, he had, somehow, always been making
his way toward&mdash;Her.</p>

<p>Thus Cartaret dreamed while Seraphin made
a hurried journey to the rue St. Andr&eacute; des Arts
and the shop of M. Fourget.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But no, but no, but no!&rdquo; Fourget&rsquo;s bushy
brows met in a frown. &ldquo;It is out of the question.
Something has happened to the boy. He
can no longer paint.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oh, well, at least monsieur could go to the
boy&rsquo;s rooms and see what he had there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Am I then a silly philanthropist?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seraphin tried to produce his false dignity.
What he brought out was something genuine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>133]</a></span>
&ldquo;I ask it from the heart,&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;Do
not I, my God, know what it is to be hungry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hungry?&rdquo; said the dealer. &ldquo;Hungry! The
boy has an uncle famously rich. What is an
uncle for? Hungry? You make <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">une b&ecirc;tise</i>.
Hungry.&rdquo; He called his clerk and took up his
hat. &ldquo;I will not go,&rdquo; he vowed. &ldquo;Hungry, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par
example</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Truly you will not,&rdquo; smiled Seraphin. &ldquo;And
do not tell him that I sent you: he is proud.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="break">The sound of the door opening interrupted
Cartaret&rsquo;s dream. He turned, a little sheepish,
wholly annoyed. Spectacled Fourget stood there,
looking very severe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was passing by,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;I have
not come to purchase anything, but I grow old:
I was tired and I climbed your stairs to rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was too late to hide those portraits. Cartaret
could only place for Fourget a chair with
its back to them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you been doing?&rdquo; asked the
dealer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>134]</a></span>
He swung &rsquo;round toward the portraits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at them!&rdquo; said Cartaret. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
merely sketches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Fourget had already looked. He was on
his feet. He was bobbing from one to the
other, his lean hands adjusting his glasses, his
shoulders stooped, his nose thrust out. He was
uttering little cries of approval.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this is good! It is good, then. This is
first-rate. This is of an excellence!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not for sale,&rdquo; said Cartaret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hein?</i>&rdquo; Fourget wheeled. &ldquo;If they are not
for sale, they are for what, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&mdash;they are merely sketches, I tell you.
I was trying my hand at a new method; but
I find there is nothing in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fourget was unbuttoning his short frock-coat.
He was reaching for his wallet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you there is everything in it. There is
the sure touch in it, the clear vision, the sympathy.
There is reputation in it. In fine, there
is money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had the wallet out as he concluded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>135]</a></span>
Cartaret shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Fourget, the dealer in him partially
overcoming the lover of art, &ldquo;not much
as yet; not a great deal of money. You have
still a long way to go; but you have found the
road, monsieur, and I want to help you on your
journey. Come, now.&rdquo; He nodded to the first
portrait. &ldquo;What do you ask for that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to sell it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poof! We shall not haggle. Tell Fourget
what you had thought of asking. Do not be
modest. Tell me&mdash;and I will give you half.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He kept it up as long as he could; he tried
at last to buy the least of the preliminary
sketches of the Rose-Lady; he offered what, to
Cartaret, were dazzling prices; but Cartaret was
not to be shaken: these experiments were not for
sale.</p>

<p>Fourget was first disappointed, then puzzled.
His enthusiasm had been genuine; but could
it be possible that Dieudonn&eacute; was mistaken?
Was Cartaret not starving? The old man was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>136]</a></span>
beginning to button his coat when a new idea
struck him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was your model?&rdquo; he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I had none,&rdquo; Cartaret stammered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;&mdash;Fourget peered hard at him through
those glistening spectacles. &ldquo;You painted them
from memory?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Cartaret felt his face redden. &ldquo;From
imagination, I mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Fourget understood. Perhaps he had
merely the typical Frenchman&rsquo;s love of romance,
which ceases only with the typical Frenchman&rsquo;s
life; or perhaps he remembered his own youth
in Besan&ccedil;on, when he, too, had wanted to be
an artist and when, among the vines on the
hillside, little Rosalie smiled at him and kissed
his ambition away&mdash;little Rosalie Poullot, dust
and ashes these twenty years in the Cimeti&egrave;re du
Mont Parnasse....</p>

<p>He turned to a pile of pot-boilers. He took
one almost at random.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This one,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I should like to buy it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>137]</a></span>
It was the worst pot-boiler of the lot. Before
the portraits, it was hopeless.</p>

<p>Cartaret half understood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t really want it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seraphin had been right: the young man was
proud. &ldquo;How then?&rdquo; demanded Fourget. &ldquo;This
also did you paint not-to-sell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I painted it to sell,&rdquo; said Cartaret miserably,
&ldquo;but it doesn&rsquo;t deserve selling&mdash;perhaps just because
I did paint it to sell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To his surprise, Fourget came to him and put
an arm on his shoulder, a withered hand patting
the American&rsquo;s back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, if but some more-famous artists felt as
you do! Come; let me have it. That is very
well. I shall sell it to a fool. Many fools are
my patrons. How else could I live? There
is not enough good art to meet all demands, or
there are not enough demands to meet all good
art. Who shall say? Suffice it there are demands
of sorts. Daily I thank the good God
for His fools....&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>138]</a></span>
Cartaret went to Les Halles and bought a
large box of strawberries.</p>


<p class="break">He had put them carefully on his window-shelf
and covered them with a copy of a last
week&rsquo;s <i>Matin</i>&mdash;being an American, he of course
read the <i>Matin</i>&mdash;for he was resolved that, now
he again had a little money, these strawberries
should be his final extravagance and should be
treasured accordingly&mdash;he had just anchored the
paper against the gentle Spring breeze when he
became aware that he had another visitor.</p>

<p>Standing by his table, much as she had stood
there on the night of his second sight of her, was
the Lady of the Rose.</p>

<p>Cartaret thought that his eyes were playing
him tricks. He rubbed his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is I,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>He thought that again he could detect the
perfume of the Azure Rose. He again thought
that he could see white mountain-tops in the
sun. He could have sworn that, in the street,
a hurdy-gurdy was playing:</p>

<span class="i1">Her throat is like the swan&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;I came in,&rdquo; she was saying, &ldquo;to see how you
were. I should have sent Chitta, but she was
so long coming back from an errand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said&mdash;he was not yet certain
of himself&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite well. But I&rsquo;m very
glad you called.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet you, sir, look pale, and your friend&rdquo;&mdash;her
forehead puckered&mdash;&ldquo;told me that you had
been ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friend?&rdquo; He spoke as if he had none
in the world, though now he knew better.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes: such a pleasant old gentleman with gray
hair and glasses. As I came in half an hour
ago, I met him on the stairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fourget!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was that his name? He seemed most anxious
about you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is my friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like him,&rdquo; said the Lady of the Rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you understand him. I didn&rsquo;t understand
him&mdash;till this morning. He is an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>140]</a></span>
art-dealer: those that he won&rsquo;t buy from think him
hard; the friends of those that he buys from
think him a fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Although he had reassured her of his health, she
seemed charmingly willing to linger. Really, she
was looking at Cartaret&rsquo;s haggard cheeks with a
wonderful sympathy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So he bought from you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only I hope <em>you</em> won&rsquo;t think him a fool,&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall consider,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;I must first
see some of your work, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She came farther into the room. She moved
with an easy dignity, her advance into the light
displaying the lines of her gracile figure, the
turn of her head discovering the young curve
of her throat; her eyes, as they moved about
his studio, were clear and starry.</p>

<p>In the presence of their original, Cartaret had
forgotten the portraits. Now she saw them and
turned scarlet.</p>

<p>It was a time for no more pride on the part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>141]</a></span>
of the painter: already, head high in air, she
had turned to go. It was a time for honest
dealing. Cartaret barred her way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you please
forgive me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She tried to pass him without a word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But listen. Only listen a minute! You
didn&rsquo;t think&mdash;oh, you didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d sold him
one of those? They were on the wall when he
came in, and I couldn&rsquo;t get them away in time.
I&rsquo;d put them up&mdash;Well, I&rsquo;d put them up there
because I&mdash;because I couldn&rsquo;t see you, so I
wanted to see them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His voice trembled; he looked ill now: she
hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What right had you, sir, to paint them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I hadn&rsquo;t any. Of course, I
hadn&rsquo;t any! But I wouldn&rsquo;t have sold them to
the Luxembourg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What was it that Fourget had told her when
he met her on the stair?&mdash;&ldquo;Mademoiselle, you
will pardon an old man: that Young Cartarette
cannot paint pot-boilers, and in consequence he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>142]</a></span>
starves. For more things than money, mademoiselle.
But because he cannot paint pot-boilers
and get money, he starves literally.&rdquo;&mdash;Her heart
smote her now, but she could not refrain from
saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the Luxembourg did not offer&mdash;in
the person of M. Fourget?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The last vestige of his pride left Cartaret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wanted to buy those portraits,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I know that my action loses by the telling of
it whatever virtue it might have had, but I&rsquo;d
rather have that happen than have you think
what you&rsquo;ve been thinking. He offered me more
for them than for all my other pictures together,
but I couldn&rsquo;t sell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a mood not to be denied: she forgave
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you, sir, must take them all down,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;and you must promise to paint no more
of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He would have promised anything: he promised
this, and he had an immediate reward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>143]</a></span>
&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;perhaps you will eat
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d&eacute;jeuner</i> with Chitta and me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Would he! He did not know that she invited
him because of Fourget&rsquo;s use of the phrase
&ldquo;starving literally.&rdquo; He accepted, declaring that
he would never more call Friday unlucky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At eleven o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At eleven,&rdquo; he bowed.</p>

<p>When she was gone, Cartaret went again to
the window that looked on the concierge&rsquo;s garden.
The robins were still singing:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seize hold of love! It is a rose&mdash;a white
rose. Take it&mdash;take it&mdash;take it now!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<br />
<span class="vsmlfont">CHIEFLY CONCERNING STRAWBERRIES</span></h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Theft in its simplicity&mdash;however sharp and rude, yet
if frankly done, and bravely&mdash;does not corrupt men&rsquo;s
souls; and they can, in a foolish, but quite vital and
faithful way, keep the feast of the Virgin Mary in the
midst of it.&mdash;Ruskin: <i>Fors Clavigera</i>.</p>
</div>


<p>It was quite true that he had resolved to be
careful of the money that old Fourget had paid
him for the pot-boiler. He still meant to be
careful of it. But he was to be a guest at
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d&eacute;jeuner</i> next morning, and a man must not
breakfast with a Princess and wear a costume
that is really shockingly shabby. Cartaret therefore
set about devising some means of bettering
his wardrobe.</p>

<p>His impulse was to buy a new suit of clothes,
as Seraphin had done when he sold his picture.
Seraphin, however, had received a good deal
more money than Cartaret, and Cartaret was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>145]</a></span>
really in earnest about his economies: when he
had spent half the afternoon in the shops, and
found that most of the ready-made suits there
exposed for sale would cost him the bulk of his
new capital, he decided to sponge his present
suit, sew on a few buttons and then sleep with
it under his mattress by way of pressing it. A
new necktie was, nevertheless, imperative: he had
been absent-mindedly wiping his brushes on the
old, and it would not do to smell more of
turpentine than the exigencies of his suit made
necessary; the scent of turpentine is not appetizing.</p>

<p>If you have never been in love, you may suppose
that the selection of so small a thing as a
necktie is trivial; otherwise, you will know that
there are occasions when it is no light matter, and
you will then understand why Cartaret found it
positively portentous. The first score of neckties
that he looked at were impossible; so were
the second. In the third he found one that would
perhaps just do, and this he had laid aside for
him while he went on to another shop. He went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>146]</a></span>
to several other shops. Whereas he had at first
found too few possibilities, he was now embarrassed
by too many. There was a flowing marine-blue
affair with white <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fleur-de-lys</i> that he thought
would do well for Seraphin and that he considered
for a moment on his own account. He went
back to the first shop and so through the lot
again. In the end, his American fear of anything
bright conquered, and he bought a gray &ldquo;four-in-hand&rdquo;
that might have been made in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>On his return he went to the window to see
how his strawberries were doing. He remembered
the anecdote about the good cleric, who
said that doubtless God could have made a better
berry, but that doubtless God never did. Cartaret
wondered if it would be an impertinence
to offer his strawberries to the Lady of the Rose.</p>

<p>They were gone.</p>

<p>He went down the stairs in two jumps. He
thrust his head into the concierge&rsquo;s cavern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s been to my room?&rdquo; he shouted. He
was still weak, but anger lent him strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>147]</a></span>
Refrogn&eacute; growled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me!&rdquo; insisted Cartaret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo; the concierge countered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your business to know. You&rsquo;re responsible.
Who&rsquo;s come in and gone out since I went
out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There must have been somebody! Somebody
has been to my room and stolen something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thefts are not so far removed from the sphere
of a concierge&rsquo;s natural activities as unduly to
excite him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To rob it is not necessary that one come in
from without,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You charge a tenant?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I charge nobody. It is you that charge, monsieur.
I did not know that you possessed to be
stolen. A thief of a tenant? But certainly. One
cannot inquire the business of one&rsquo;s tenants. What
house is without a little thief?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe you did it!&rdquo; said Cartaret.</p>

<p>Refrogn&eacute; whistled, in the darkness, a bar of
&ldquo;Margarita.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>148]</a></span>
Houdon was passing by. He made suave enquiries.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But not Refrogn&eacute;,&rdquo; he assured Cartaret. &ldquo;You
do an injustice to a worthy man, my dear friend.
Besides, what is a box of strawberries to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret felt that he was in danger of making
a mountain of a molehill; he had the morbid fear,
common to his countrymen, of appearing ridiculous.
It occurred to him that it would not have
been beyond Houdon to appropriate the berries,
if he had happened into the room and found
its master absent; but to bother further was to be
once more absurd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose it does matter,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but
my supplies have been going pretty fast lately,
and if I was to catch the thief, I&rsquo;d hammer the
life out of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Magnificent!&rdquo; gurgled Houdon as he passed
gesturing into the street.</p>

<p>Cartaret returned toward his room. The dusk
had fallen and, if he had not known the way so
well, he would have had trouble in finding it. He
was tired, too, and so he went slowly. That he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>149]</a></span>
also went softly he did not realize until he gently
pushed open the door to his quarters.</p>

<p>A shadowy figure was silhouetted against the
window out of which Cartaret kept his supplies,
and the figure seemed to have some of them in its
hands.</p>

<p>Cartaret&rsquo;s anger was still hot. Now it flamed
to a sudden fury. He did not pause to consider
the personality, or even the garb, of the thief.
He saw nothing, thought nothing, save that he
was being robbed. He charged the dim figure;
tackled it as he once tackled runners on the football-field;
fell with it much as he had fallen with
those runners in the days of old&mdash;except that he
fell among a hail of food-stuffs&mdash;and then found
himself tragically holding to the floor the duenna
Chitta.</p>

<p>It was a terrible thing, this battle with a frightened
woman. Cartaret tried to rise, but she
gripped him fast. His amazement first, and next
his mortification, would have left him nerveless,
but Chitta was fighting like a tigress. His face
was scratched and one finger bitten, before he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>150]</a></span>
could hold her quiet enough to say, in slow French:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not know that it was you. You are
welcome to what you want. I am going to let
you go. Don&rsquo;t struggle. I shan&rsquo;t hurt you. Get
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He thanked Heaven that she understood at least
a little of the language. Shaken, he got to his
own feet; but Chitta, instead of rising, surprisingly
knelt at his.</p>

<p>She spouted a long speech of infinite emotion.
She wept. She clasped and unclasped her hands.
She pointed to the room of her mistress; then to
her mouth, and then rubbed that portion of her
figure over the spot where the appetite is appeased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean,&rdquo; gasped Cartaret&mdash;&ldquo;do you
mean that you and your mistress&rdquo;&mdash;this was terrible!&mdash;&ldquo;have
been poor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chitta had come to the room without her head-dress,
and the subsequent battle had sent her hair
in dank coils about her shoulders. She nodded;
the shaken coils were like so many serpents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that she has been hungry?&mdash;Hungry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A violent negative. Chitta bobbed toward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>151]</a></span>
Cartaret&rsquo;s rifled stores and then toward the street, as
if to include other stores in the same circle of
depredation. She was also plainly indignant at
the idea that she would permit her mistress to be
hungry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Cartaret, &ldquo;I see! You are a consistent
thief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This time Chitta&rsquo;s nod was a proud one; but
she pointed again to the other room and shook
her head violently; then to herself and nodded
once more. Words could not more plainly have
said that, although she had been supplementing
her provisions by petty thefts, her employer knew
nothing about them.</p>

<p>And she must not be told. Again Chitta began
to bob and moan and weep. She pointed across
the hallway, put a finger to her lips, shook her
old head and finally held out her clasped hands in
supplication.</p>

<p>Cartaret emptied his pockets. He wished he
had not been so extravagant as to buy that necktie.
He handed to Chitta all the money left from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>152]</a></span>
price that Fourget had paid him, to the last five-centime
piece.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take this,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and be sure you don&rsquo;t
ever let your mistress know where it came from.
I shan&rsquo;t tell anybody about you. When you want
more, come direct to me.&rdquo; He knew that he could
paint marketable pot-boilers now.</p>

<p>She wanted to kiss his hand, but he hurried
from the woman and left her groveling behind
him....</p>

<p>&ldquo;M. Refrogn&eacute;,&rdquo; he said to the concierge, &ldquo;I owe
you an apology. I am sorry for the way I spoke
to you a while ago. I have found those strawberries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said Refrogn&eacute;. He added, when Cartaret
had passed: &ldquo;In his stomach, most likely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slowly the horror of having had to use physical
force against a woman left Cartaret. He started
for a long walk and thought many things. He
thought, as he trudged at last across L&rsquo;Etoile, how
the April starshine was turning the Arc de Triomphe
to silver, and how the lovers on the benches at
the junction of the rue Lauriston and the avenue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>153]</a></span>
Kl&eacute;ber made Napoleon&rsquo;s arch in praise of war a
monument to softer passions. He thought, as he
strolled from the avenue d&rsquo;Eylan and across the
Place Victor Hugo, how the heart of that poet,
whose statue here represented him as so much the
politician, must grow warm when, as now, boys
and girls passed arm in arm about the pediment.
The night bore jonquils in her hands and wore a
spray of wisteria in her hair. Brocaded ghosts of
the old r&eacute;gime must be pacing a stately measure at
Ranelagh, and all the elves of Spring were dancing
in the Bois.</p>

<p>The Princess was poor. That brought her
nearer to him: it gave him a chance to help her.
Cartaret found it hard to be sorry that she was
poor.</p>

<p>Sometimes a mattress is doubtless as efficient
a means of pressing one&rsquo;s clothes as any other
means, but doubtless always a good deal depends
upon the mattress. By way of general rules, it
may be laid down, for instance, that the mattress
employed must not be too thin, must not be
stuffed with a material so gregarious as to gather
together in lumpy communities, and must not
sag in the middle. Cartaret&rsquo;s mattress failed to
meet these fundamental requirements, and when
he made his careful toilet on the morning that he
was to take <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d&eacute;jeuner</i> at the Room Across the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>155]</a></span>
Landing, he became uneasily aware that his clothes
betrayed certain evidences of what had happened
to them. He had been up half a dozen times in
the night to rearrange the garments, in fear of
just such a misfortune; but his activities were
badly repaid; the front of the suit bore a series of
peculiar wrinkles, rather like the complicated
hatchments on an ancient family&rsquo;s escutcheon; he
could not see how, when the coat was on him, its
back looked, and he was afraid to speculate. With
his mirror now hung high and now standing on
the floor, he practiced before it until he happily
discovered that the wrinkles could be given a
more or less reasonable excuse if he could only remember
to adopt and assume a mildly Pre-Raphaelite
bearing.</p>

<p>Something else that his glass showed him gave
him more anxiety and appeared beyond concealment:
Chitta&rsquo;s claws had left two long scratches
across his right cheek. He had no powder and
no money to buy any. He did think of trying a
touch of his own paint, but he feared that oils
were not suited to the purpose and would only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>156]</a></span>
make the wound more noticeable. He would
simply have to let it go.</p>

<p>He had wakened with the first ray of sunlight
that set the birds to singing in the garden, and,
Chitta&rsquo;s fall of the previous evening having spilled
his coffee and devastated his supplies, he was
forced to go without a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit d&eacute;jeuner</i>. He found
a little tobacco in one of his coat-pockets and
smoked that until the bells of St. Sulpice, after an
unconscionable delay, rang the glad hour for which
he waited.</p>

<p>Chitta opened the door to his knock, and he
was at once aware of her mistress standing, in
white, behind her; but the old duenna was aware
of it too and ordered herself accordingly. Chitta
bowed low enough to appease the watchful Lady
of the Rose, but Chitta&rsquo;s eyes, as she lowered them,
glowered at him suspiciously. It was clear that
she by no means joined in the welcome that the
Lady immediately accorded him.</p>

<p>The Lady, in clinging muslin and with a black
lace scarf of delicate workmanship draped over
her black hair, gave him her hand, and this time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>157]</a></span>
Cartaret was not slow to kiss it. The action was
one to which he was scarcely accustomed, and he
hesitated between the fear of being discourteously
brief about it and the fear of being discourteously
long. He could be certain only of how cool and
firm her hand was and, as he looked up from it,
how pink and fresh her cheeks.</p>

<p>It was then that the Lady saw the scratches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you have had an accident!&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>Cartaret&rsquo;s hand went to his face. He looked
at Chitta: Chitta&rsquo;s returning glance was something
between an appeal and a threat, but a trifle nearer
the latter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had a little fall,&rdquo; said Cartaret, &ldquo;and I was
scratched in falling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The room was bare, but clean and pleasant,
fresh from the constant application of Chitta&rsquo;s
mop and broom, fresher from the Spring breeze
that came in through the front windows, and
freshest from the presence of the Lady of the
Rose. Two curtained corners seemed to contain
beds. At the rear, behind a screen, there must
have been a gas-stove where Chitta could soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>158]</a></span>
be heard at work upon the breakfast. What
furniture there was bore every evidence of being
Parisian, purchased in the Quarter; there was
none to indicate the nationality of the tenants;
and the bright little table, at which Cartaret was
presently seated so comfortably as to forget the
necessity of the Pre-Raphaelite pose, was Parisian
too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must speak French,&rdquo; smiled the Lady&mdash;how
very white her teeth were, and how very
red her lips!&mdash;as she looked at him across the coffee-urn:
&ldquo;that is the sole condition that, sir, I
impose upon you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Willingly,&rdquo; said Cartaret, in the language
thus imposed; &ldquo;but why, when you speak English
so well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because&rdquo;&mdash;the Lady was half serious about
it&mdash;&ldquo;I had to promise Chitta that, under threat
of her leaving Paris; and if she left Paris, I should
of course have to leave it, too. French she understands
a little, as you know, but not English,
and&rdquo;&mdash;the Lady&rsquo;s pink deepened&mdash;&ldquo;she says that
English is the one language of which she cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>159]</a></span>
even guess the meaning when she hears it, because
English is the one language that can be spoken
with the lips only, and spoken as if the speaker&rsquo;s
face were a mask.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said he should have thought that Chitta
would pick it up from her. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it
comes so readily to you: you answered in it instinctively
that time when I first saw you. Don&rsquo;t
you remember?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember. I was very frightened. Perhaps
I used it when you did because we had an English
governess at my home and speak it much in the
family. We speak it when we do not want the
servants to understand, and so we have kept it
from Chitta.&rdquo; She was pouring the coffee. &ldquo;Tell
me truly: do I indeed speak it well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excellently. Of course you are a little precise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How precise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you said, that time, &lsquo;It is I&rsquo;; we generally
say &lsquo;It&rsquo;s me&rsquo;&mdash;like the French, you understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>160]</a></span>
If Princesses could pout, he would have said
that she pouted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I was right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not entirely. You weren&rsquo;t colloquial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was correct,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;&lsquo;It is I&rsquo; is correct.
My grammar says that the verb &lsquo;To be&rsquo;
takes the same case after it as before it. If the
Americans say something else, they do not speak
good English.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The English say it, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the Lady with an emphatic nod,
&ldquo;the English also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a simple breakfast, but excellently
cooked, and Cartaret had come to it with a
healthy hunger. Chitta was present only in the
capacity of servant; but managed to be constantly
within earshot and generally to have hostess and
guest under her supervision. He felt her eyes
upon him when she brought in the highly-seasoned
omelette, when she replenished the coffee; frequently
he even caught her peeping around the
screen that hid the stove. It was a marvel that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>161]</a></span>
she could cook so well, since she was forever deserting
her post. She made Cartaret blush with
the memory of his gift to her; she made him feel
that his gift had only increased her distrust; when
he fell to talking about himself, he made light of
his poverty, so that, should Chitta&rsquo;s evident
scruples against him ever lead her to betray what
he had done, the Lady might not feel that he had
sacrificed too much in giving so little.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Cartaret was in no mood for complaint:
he was sitting opposite his Princess and
was happy. He told her of his life in America,
of football and of Broadway. It is a rare thing for
a lover to speak of his sister, but Cartaret even
mentioned Cora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is she afraid of you, monsieur?&rdquo; asked the
Lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine Cora being afraid of any mere
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the Lady; &ldquo;then the American
brothers are different from brothers in my country.
I have a brother. I think he is the handsomest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>162]</a></span>
and bravest man in the world, and I love him.
But I fear him too. I fear him very much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your own brother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Lady was giving Cartaret some more omelette.
Cartaret, holding his ready plate, saw her
glance toward the rear of the room and saw her
meet the eyes of Chitta, whose face was thrust
around the screen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Lady.</p>

<p>It struck Cartaret that she dropped her brother
rather quickly. She talked of other things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your name,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is English: the concierge
gave it me. It is English, is it not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had made enquiries about him, then: Cartaret
liked that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My people were English, long ago,&rdquo; he answered.
He grew bold. He had been a fool not
to make enquiries about her, but now he would
make them at first hand. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know your
name,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>He saw her glance again toward the rear of the
room, but when he looked he saw nobody. The
Lady was saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>163]</a></span>
&ldquo;Urola.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It helped him very little. He said;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That sounds Spanish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instantly her head went up. There was blue
fire in her eyes as she answered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not one drop of Spanish blood; not
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had meant no offense, yet it was clear that
he came dangerously near one. He made haste to
apologize.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not understand,&rdquo; she said, smiling a
little. &ldquo;In my country we hate the Spaniard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is your country?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the most natural of questions&mdash;he had
put it once before&mdash;yet he had now no sooner
uttered it than he felt that he had committed another
indiscretion. This time, when she glanced
at the rear of the room, he distinctly saw Chitta&rsquo;s
head disappearing behind the screen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a far country,&rdquo; said Mlle. Urola. &ldquo;It is
a wild country. We have no opportunities to
study art in my country. So I came to Paris.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After that there was nothing for him to do but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>164]</a></span>
to be interested in her studies, and of them she
told him willingly enough. She was very ambitious;
she worked hard, but she made, she said,
little progress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The people that have no feeling for any art I
pity,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but, oh, I pity more those who
want to be some sort of artist and cannot be! The
desire without the talent, that kills.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chitta was coming back, bearing aloft a fresh
dish. She bore it with an air more haughty than
any she had yet assumed. Directing at Cartaret a
glance of pride and scorn, she set before her mistress&mdash;Cartaret&rsquo;s
strawberries.</p>

<p>The Lady clapped her pretty hands. She
laughed with delight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is a surprise! I had not
known that we were to have strawberries. It is
so like Chitta. She is so kind and thoughtful,
monsieur. Always she has for me some surprise
like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a surprise,&rdquo; said Cartaret. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll
enjoy it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>165]</a></span>
She served the berries while Chitta stalked
away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I find,&rdquo; confessed the Lady in English, &ldquo;that
they are not so good below as they seemed on
the top. You will not object?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oh, no: Cartaret wouldn&rsquo;t object.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Mlle. Urola, &ldquo;that I should
reprimand her, for their quality is&rdquo;&mdash;she frowned
at the berries&mdash;&ldquo;inferior; but I have not the heart.
Not for the whole world could I hurt her feelings.
She is both so kind and so proud, and she is such
a marvel of economy. You, sir, would not guess
how well she makes me fare upon how small an
expense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After breakfast, she showed him some examples
of her work. It had delicacy and feeling. An unprejudiced
critic would have said that she had
much to learn in the way of technique, but to Cartaret
every one of her sketches was a marvel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; she said, again in English, as she produced
a drawing from the bottom of her bundle,
&ldquo;does not compare with what you did, sir, but it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>166]</a></span>
is not the work of a flatterer, since it is my own
work. It is I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a rapid sketch of herself and it was, as
she had said, the work of no flatterer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like that least of all,&rdquo; declared Cartaret, in
the language to which she had returned; but he
wanted her to forget those portraits he had made.
He caught, consequently, at trifles. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t
you say &lsquo;It&rsquo;s me&rsquo;?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>She clasped her hands behind her and stood
looking up at him with her chin tilted and her unconscious
lips close to his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say what is right, sir,&rdquo; she challenged.</p>

<p>He laughed, but shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know better,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. She was smiling, but serious.
&ldquo;It is I that am right. And even if I learned that
I were wrong, I would now not change. It would
be a surrender to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret found his color high. His mind was
putting into her words a meaning he was afraid
she might see that he put there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not to me,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>167]</a></span>
&ldquo;Yes, yes, to you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Surrender! What a troublesome word she was
using!</p>

<p>The chin went higher; the lips came nearer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A complete surrender, sir.&rdquo; Quickly she
stepped back. If she had read his face rightly,
her face gave no hint of it, but she was at once
her former self. &ldquo;And that I will never do,&rdquo; she
said, reverting to French.</p>

<p>It was Cartaret&rsquo;s turn to want to change the
subject. He did it awkwardly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you been in the Bois?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>No, she had not been in the Bois. She loved
nature too well to care for artificial scenery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the Bois is the sort of art that improves
on nature,&rdquo; he protested; &ldquo;at least, so the Parisian
will tell you; and, really, it is beautiful now. You
ought to see it. I was there last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go alone into the Bois in the night? Is
not that dangerous?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He could not tell whether she was mocking him.
He said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>168]</a></span>
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t dangerous in the afternoons, at any
rate. Let me take you there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hesitated. Chitta was clattering dishes in
the improvised kitchen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said the Lady.</p>

<p>Cartaret&rsquo;s heart bounded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>The dishes clattered mightily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How prompt you are!&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;No,
not now. I have my lessons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said the Lady of the Rose. &ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret&rsquo;s face brightened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is,&rdquo; explained his hostess, &ldquo;if you will
not try to teach me English, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Lady&rsquo;s &ldquo;perhaps&rdquo; meant &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; it seemed,
for, when Cartaret called for her the next day,
he found her ready to go to the Bois, and not the
Lady only: hovering severely in the immediate
background, like a thunder-cloud over a Spring
landscape, was Chitta, wrapped in a shawl of
marvelous lace, doubtless from her own country,
and crowned with a brilliant bonnet unmistakably
procured at some second-hand shop off the rue St.
Jacques. The Lady noticed his expression of bewilderment
and appeared a little annoyed by it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>170]</a></span>
&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Chitta accompanies us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret had to submit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>He proposed a taxi-cab to the Bois&mdash;he had
visited the Mont de Pi&eacute;t&eacute;&mdash;but the Lady would
not hear of it; she was used to walking; she was a
good walker; she liked to walk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s miles,&rdquo; Cartaret protested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is nothing,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>Her utmost concession was to go by tram to
the <i>Arc</i>.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful day in the Bois, with half
of Paris there: carriages from the Faubourg St.
Germain, motors of the smart set, hired conveyances
full of tourists. The trees were a tender
green; the footways crowded by the Parisian
bourgeois, making a day of it with his family.
Slim officers walked, in black jackets and red
trousers, the calves of their legs compressed in
patent-leather riding-leggings; women of the half-world
showed brilliant toilettes that had been
copied by ladies of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">haut monde</i>, who, driven
past, wore them not quite so well. Grotesquely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>171]</a></span>
clipped French poodles rode in the carriages, and
Belgian police-dogs in the automobiles; thin-nosed
collies frolicked after their masters; here and
there a tailless English sheep-dog waddled by,
or a Russian boar-hound paced sedately; children
played on the grass and dashed across the paths
with a suddenness that threatened the safety of
the adult pedestrians.</p>

<p>Cartaret led the way into the less frequented
portions of the great park beyond the Lac Inf&eacute;rieur.
The Lady was pleasantly beside him,
Chitta unpleasantly at his heels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you admit it&rsquo;s worth coming to see?&rdquo;
he began in English. &ldquo;When I was here, under
the stars, the other night&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must speak French,&rdquo; the Lady smilingly
interrupted. &ldquo;You must remember my promise
to Chitta.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret ground his teeth. He spoke thereafter
in French, but he lowered his voice so as to
be sure that Chitta could not understand him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was thinking then that you ought to see
it.&rdquo; He took his courage in both hands. &ldquo;I was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>172]</a></span>
wishing very much that you were with me.&rdquo; His
brown eyes sought hers steadily. &ldquo;May I tell
you all that I was wishing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Her tone was conventional enough, but in her
face he read&mdash;and he was sure that she had meant
him to read&mdash;a something deeper.</p>

<p>He put it to her flatly: &ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was looking now at the fresh green leaves
above them. When she looked down, she was
still smiling, but her smile was wistful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When dreams come true, perhaps,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Do dreams ever come true in the American
United States, monsieur?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The spell of the Spring was dangerously upon
them both. Cartaret&rsquo;s breath came quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish&mdash;I wish that you were franker with
me,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But am I ever anything except frank?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re&mdash;I know I haven&rsquo;t any right to expect
your confidence: you scarcely know me. But why
won&rsquo;t you tell me even where you come from and
who you are?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>173]</a></span>
&ldquo;You know my name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know a part of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My little name is&mdash;it is Vitoria.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;V-i-t-t-o-r-i-a?&rdquo; he spelled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but with one &lsquo;t,&rsquo;&rdquo; the Lady said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vitoria Urola,&rdquo; he repeated.</p>

<p>She raised her even brows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; of course,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>Somehow it struck him that its sound was
scarcely familiar to her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I pronounce it badly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no: you are quite correct.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But not quite to be trusted?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him doubtfully. She looked at
Chitta and gave her a quick order that sent the
duenna reluctantly ahead of them. Then the
Lady put her gloved hand on Cartaret&rsquo;s arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want you to be my friend,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am your friend,&rdquo; he protested: &ldquo;that is what
I want you to believe. That is why I ask you
to be frank with me. I want you to tell me just
enough to let me help&mdash;to let me protect you. If
you are in danger, I want&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>174]</a></span>
&ldquo;You might be my danger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She bowed assent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, do not ask me why. I shall not tell you.
I shall never tell you&mdash;no more,&rdquo; she smiled, &ldquo;than
I shall ever say for you &lsquo;it&rsquo;s me.&rsquo; It is very kind
of you to want to be my friend. I am alone here
in Paris, except for poor Chitta, and I shall be
glad if you will be my friend; but it will not be
very easy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be hard to be anything else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not for you: you are too curious. My friend
must let me be just what I am here. All that I
was before I came to Paris, all that I may be
after I leave it, he must ask nothing about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret looked long into her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;I am glad to have
that much. And&mdash;thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stuck to his side of their agreement; not
only during that afternoon in the Bois, but during
the days that followed. He worked hard. He
turned out one really good picture, and he turned
out many successful pot-boilers. He would not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>175]</a></span>
impose these on Fourget, because old Fourget had
already been too kind to him; but Lepoittevin
wanted such stuff, and Cartaret let him have it.</p>

<p>Cartaret worked gladly now, because he was,
however little she might guess it, working for
Vitoria. He had left for himself precisely enough
to keep him alive, but every third or fourth day
he would have the happiness of slipping a little
silver into Chitta&rsquo;s horny palm: Chitta came
readily to the habit of waiting for him on the
stair. He grew happier day by day, and looked&mdash;as
who does not?&mdash;the better for it. He sought
out Seraphin and Varachon; he bought brandy
for Houdon; went to hear Devignes sing, and once
he had Armand Garnier to luncheon. He rewarded
the hurdy-gurdy so splendidly that it was
a nightly visitor to the rue du Val de Gr&acirc;ce: the
entire street was whistling &ldquo;Annie Laurie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seraphin guessed the truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, my friend,&rdquo; he nodded, &ldquo;that foolish one,
Houdon, says that you have again decided to
spend of your income: <em>I</em> know that you are somehow
making largess with your heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>176]</a></span>
Cartaret took frequent walks with Vitoria,
Chitta always two feet behind, never closer, but
never farther away. Often he saw the Lady to
her classes, more frequently they walked to the
Ile Saint Louis, or between the old houses of the
rue des Francs Bourgeois; to the Jardin des
Plantes, or into the Cours de Dragon or St. Germain
des Pr&eacute;s: Chitta&rsquo;s unsophisticated mind
should have been improved by a thorough knowledge
of picturesque Paris.</p>

<p>He was guilty of trying to elude the guardian&mdash;guilty
of some rather shabby tricks in that direction&mdash;and
he suffered the more in conscience because
they were almost uniformly unsuccessful.
More than once, however, he reached a state of
exaltation in which he forgot Chitta, cared nothing
about Chitta, and then he felt nearer Heaven.</p>

<p>On one such occasion he was actually nearer
than the site usually ascribed to the Celestial City.
With Vitoria and her guardian he had climbed&mdash;it
was at his own malign suggestion&mdash;to Montmartre
and, since Chitta feared the funicular, had
toiled up the last steep ascent into Notre Dame de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>177]</a></span>
Sacre Coeur. Chitta&rsquo;s piety&mdash;or her exhaustion&mdash;kept
her long upon her knees in that Byzantine
nave, and the Lady and Cartaret had a likely
flying-start up the stairs to the tower. Cartaret
possessed the wit to say nothing, but he noticed
that Vitoria&rsquo;s blue eyes shone with a light of adventure,
which tacitly approved of the escapade,
and that her step was as quick as his own when
Chitta&rsquo;s slower step, heavy breathing and muttered
imprecations became audible below them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure the old girl will have to rest on the
way up, for all her spryness,&rdquo; thought Cartaret.
&ldquo;If we can only hold this pace, we ought to have
five minutes alone on the ramparts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had quite five minutes and, no other sight-seers
being about, they were quite alone. Below
them, under a faintly blue haze, Paris lay like
an outspread map, with here and there a church
steeple rising above the level of the page. The
roof of the Op&eacute;ra, the gilt dome of Napoleon&rsquo;s
tomb and the pointing finger of the Tour Eiffel
were immediately individualized, but all the rest
of the city merged into a common maze about the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>178]</a></span>
curving Seine with the red sun setting beyond the
Ile de Puteaux.</p>

<p>Vitoria leaned on the rampart. She was panting
a little from her climb; her cheeks were flushed,
and her whole face glowing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is as if we were gods on some star,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;looking down upon a world that is strange to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was speaking in English. Cartaret bent
closer. Pledges of mere friendship ceased, for the
moment, to appear of primary importance: he
wanted, suddenly, to make the most of a little
time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I never to see you alone?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>She forsook the view of Paris to give him a
second&rsquo;s glance. There was something roguish
in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chitta,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;has not yet arrived.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He felt himself a poor hand at love-making.
Its language was upon his tongue&mdash;perhaps the
slower now because he so much meant what he
wanted to say. His jaw set, the lines at his mouth
deepened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never thought much,&rdquo; he blundered,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>179]</a></span>
&ldquo;about some of the things that most fellows think
a lot about. I mean I&rsquo;ve never&mdash;at least not till
lately&mdash;thought much about love and&mdash;&rdquo; he
choked on the word&mdash;&ldquo;and marriage; but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She cut him short. Her speech was slow and
deliberate. Her eyes were on his, and in them
he saw something at once firm and sad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor I, my friend,&rdquo; she was saying: &ldquo;it is a
subject that I am forbidden to think about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If she conveyed a command, he disobeyed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d think about it
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am forbidden to think about it,&rdquo; she continued,
&ldquo;and I do not think about it because I
shall not marry any one&mdash;at least not any one that&mdash;that
I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her voice dropped into silence. She turned
from him to the sunset over the gray city.</p>

<p>Cartaret&rsquo;s exaltation left him more suddenly
than it had come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any one that you care for?&rdquo; he asked in a
lowered tone.</p>

<p>Still facing the city, she bowed assent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>180]</a></span>
&ldquo;But, in Heaven&rsquo;s name, whom else should you
marry except somebody that you care for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; urged Cartaret, &ldquo;you&mdash;you&rsquo;re not
engaged, are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She faced him then, still with that something
at once firm and sad in her fine eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said; but he must have shown a little
of the hope he found in that monosyllable, for
she went on: &ldquo;Yet I shall never marry any one
that I care for. That is all that I may tell you&mdash;my
<em>friend</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a hurrying tug puffs up to the liner that it is
to tow safely into port, Chitta puffed up to her
mistress. She met a Cartaret, could she have
guessed it, as hopeless as she wanted him to be.</p>

<p>He did his best to put from him all desire to
unravel the mystery, and for some days he was
again content to remain Vitoria&rsquo;s unquestioning
friend. She had told him that she could not marry
him: nothing could have been plainer. What more
could he gain by further enquiry? Did she mean
that she loved somebody else whom she could not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>181]</a></span>
marry? Or did she mean that she loved, but
could not marry&mdash;<em>him</em>? Cartaret highly resolved
to take what good the gods provided: to remain
her friend; to work on, in secret, for her comfort,
and to be as happy as he could in so much of her
companionship as she permitted him. He would
never tell her that he loved her.</p>

<p>And then, very early on an evening in May,
Destiny, who had been somnolent under the soft
influence of Spring, awoke and once more took a
hand in Cartaret&rsquo;s affairs and those of the Lady
of the Rose.</p>

<p>Cartaret had just returned from a mission to Lepoittevin&rsquo;s
shop and, having there disposed of a
particularly bad picture, had put money in his
purse: Chitta was waiting on the stairs and accepted
the bulk of his earnings with her usual bad
grace. He went into his studio, leaving the door
ajar. The cool breeze of the Spring twilight fluttered
the curtains; it bore upward the laughter of
the concierge&rsquo;s children, playing at diavolo in the
garden; it brought the fainter notes of the hurdy-gurdy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>182]</a></span>
grinding out its music somewhere farther
down the street.</p>

<p>Somebody was tapping at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; he called.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;<em>I</em>,&rdquo; came the answer, with the least perceptible
pause before the pronoun. &ldquo;May I come
in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do,&rdquo; he said, and rose.</p>

<p>Before he could reach the door, Vitoria had
entered, closing it carefully behind her. He could
see that she was in her student&rsquo;s blouse; tendrils
of her hair, slightly disarrayed, curled about the
nape of her white neck; her delicate nostrils were
extended and her manner strangely quiet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is good of you,&rdquo; he gratefully began. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t expect&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this that you have been doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her tone, though low, was hasty. Cartaret bewilderedly
realized that she was angry. Before
he could reply, she had repeated her question:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir, what is this that you have been doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo; He had drawn away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>183]</a></span>
from her, his face unmistakably expressive of his
puzzled pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been&mdash;&mdash; oh, that I should live to
say it!&mdash;you have been giving money to my maid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew back farther now. He was detected;
he was ashamed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he confessed; &ldquo;I thought&mdash;You see, she
gave me to understand that you were&mdash;were poor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of my family has ever taken charity of
any man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charity?&rdquo; He did not dare to look at her, but
he knew just how high she was holding her head
and just how her eyes were flashing. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t
that. Believe me&mdash;please believe me when I say
it wasn&rsquo;t that. It never struck me in that way.&rdquo;
He was on the point of telling her how he had
caught Chitta red-handed in a theft, and how this
had led to his enlightenment; but he realized in
time that such an explanation would only deepen
the wound that he had inflicted on the Lady&rsquo;s
pride. &ldquo;I merely thought,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;that it
was one comrade&mdash;one neighbor&mdash;helping another.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>184]</a></span>
&ldquo;How much have you given that wretched
woman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must know!&rdquo; She stamped her foot.
&ldquo;Or are you, after all, one of those rich Americans
that do not have to count their money, and that
are proud of insulting the people of older and
poorer countries by flinging it at them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a bitter thing to say. He received it
with head still bent, and his answer was scarcely
a whisper:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not quite rich.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then count. Recollect yourself, sir, and
count. Tell me, and you shall be repaid. Within
three days you shall be repaid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It never occurred to him further to humiliate
her by seeking sympathy through a reference to his
own poverty. He looked up. In her clenched
hands and parted lips, in her hot eyes and face, he
saw the tokens of the blow that he had dealt her.
He came toward her with outstretched hands, petitioning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you guess why I did this?&rdquo; he asked her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>185]</a></span>
His amazement, even his sorrow, left him. In
their place was only the sublimation of a worthy
tenderness, the masterfulness of a firm resolve.
His face was tense. &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want you to answer me; I wouldn&rsquo;t say this if I
were going to allow you to make any reply. I
don&rsquo;t want pity; I don&rsquo;t deserve it. Anything else
I wouldn&rsquo;t ask, because I don&rsquo;t deserve anything
else, either, and don&rsquo;t hope for it. I just want to
make my action clear to you. Perhaps I should
have done for any neighbor what I did for&mdash;what
little I have been doing; I trust so; I don&rsquo;t know.
But the reason I did it in this case was a reason
that I&rsquo;ve never had in all my life before. Remember,
I&rsquo;m hopeless and I shan&rsquo;t let you reply to
me: I did this because&rdquo;&mdash;his unswerving glance
was on hers now&mdash;&ldquo;because I love you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she did reply. At first she seemed unable
to credit him, but then her face became scarlet
and her eyes blazed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Love me! And you do this? Yes, sir, insult
me by contributing&mdash;and through my servant&mdash;to
my support! If I had not come back unexpectedly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>186]</a></span>
but now and found her counting more silver than
I knew she could by right possess&mdash;if I had not
frightened her into a confession&mdash;it might have
gone on for months.&rdquo; The Lady stopped abruptly.
&ldquo;How long <em>has</em> it been going on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you that I have no idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But once, sir, was enough! You insult me
with your money, and when I ask you why you
do it, you answer that you love me. Love!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She uttered the concluding word with an intensity
of scorn that lashed him. She turned to
go, but, as on the occasion of their first meeting,
he stepped forward and barred the way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have no right to put that construction on
what I say. Our points of view are different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;thank the Holy Saints they <em>are</em> different!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall try to understand yours; I beg you to
try to understand mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their eyes met again. In his it was impossible
for her not to read the truth. Slowly she lowered
hers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In my country,&rdquo; she said, more softly now, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>187]</a></span>
still proudly, &ldquo;love is another sort of thing. In
my country I should have said: &lsquo;If you respect me,
sir, you perhaps love me; if you do not respect me,
it is out of the question that you should love me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Respect you?&rdquo; This was a challenge to his
love that he could not leave unanswered. His
voice rose fresh and clear. He was no longer under
the necessity of seeking words: they leaped, living,
to his lips. &ldquo;Respect you? Good God, I&rsquo;ve
been worshiping the very thought of you from
the first glimpse of you I ever had. This miserable
room has been a holy place to me because you
have twice been in it. It&rsquo;s been a holy place,
because, from the moment I first found you here,
it has been a place where I dreamed of you. Night
and day I&rsquo;ve dreamed of you; and yet have I ever
once knowingly done you any harm, trespassed or
presumed on your kindness? I&rsquo;ve seen no pure
morning without thinking of you, no beautiful
sunset without remembering you; you&rsquo;ve been the
harmony of every bar of music, of every bird-song,
that I&rsquo;ve heard. When you were gone, the
world was empty for me; when I was with you,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>188]</a></span>
all the rest of the world was nothing, and less
than nothing. Respect you? Why, I should have
cut off my right hand before I let you even guess
what you&rsquo;ve discovered to-day!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he spoke, her whole attitude altered. Her
hands were still clenched at her sides, but clenched
now in another emotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is&mdash;is this true?&rdquo; she asked. Her voice was
very low.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet&rdquo;&mdash;she seemed to be not so much addressing
him as trying to quiet an accuser in her
own heart&mdash;&ldquo;I never spoke one word that could
give you any hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not one,&rdquo; he gravely assented. &ldquo;I never
asked for hope; I don&rsquo;t expect it now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it is&mdash;it is really true?&rdquo; she murmured.</p>

<p>Again he spoke in answer to what she seemed
rather to address to her own heart:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you found out what I&rsquo;d done, I wanted
you to know why I&rsquo;d done it&mdash;and no more. If
you hadn&rsquo;t found out about Chitta, I would never
have told you&mdash;this.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>189]</a></span>
She tried to smile, but something caught the
smile and broke it. With a sudden movement,
she raised her white hands to her burning face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;why did you tell me?
Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you accused me, because&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He
could not stand there and see her suffer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been a brute,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a bungling
brute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; She refused to hear him.</p>

<p>He drew her hands from before her face and revealed
it, the underlip indrawn, the blue eyes
swimming in hushed tears, all humbled in a wistful
appeal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A brute!&rdquo; he repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you are not!&rdquo; Her fingers closed on his.
&ldquo;You are splendid; you are fine; you are all that
I&mdash;that I ever&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vitoria!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Out in the rue du Val de Gr&acirc;ce that rattletrap
French hurdy-gurdy struck up &ldquo;Annie Laurie.&rdquo;
It played badly; its time was uncertain and its conception
of the tune was questionable; yet Cartaret
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>190]</a></span>
thought that, save for her voice, he had never
heard diviner melody. She was looking up at him,
her hands clasped in his over his pounding heart,
her eyes like altar-fires, her lips sacrosanct, and,
wreathing her upturned face, seeming to float
upon the twilight, hovered, fresh from sunlit
mountain-crests of virgin snow, the subtle and
haunting perfume that was like a poem in a tongue
unknown: the perfume of the Azure Rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vitoria!&rdquo; he began again. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean
that you&mdash;that you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She interrupted him with a sharp cry. She
freed her hands. She went by him to the door.</p>

<p>Her voice, as she paused there, was broken, but
brave:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not understand. How could you?
And I cannot tell you. Only&mdash;only it must be
&lsquo;Good-by.&rsquo; Often I have wondered how Love
would come to me, and whether he would come
singing, as he comes to most, or with a sword,
as he comes to some.&rdquo; She opened the door and
stepped across the threshold. She was closing it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>191]</a></span>
upon herself when she spoke, but she held it open
and kept her eyes on Cartaret until she ended. &ldquo;I
know now, my beloved: he has come with a
sword.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
<br />
<span class="vsmlfont">TELLS HOW CARTARET&rsquo;S FORTUNE TURNED TWICE
IN A FEW HOURS AND HOW HE FOUND ONE
THING AND LOST ANOTHER</span></h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>A man is rich in proportion to the things he can
afford to let alone.&mdash;Thoreau: <i>Walden</i>.</p>
</div>


<p>A great deal has been said, to not much purpose,
about the vagaries of the feminine heart;
but its masculine counterpart is equally mysterious.
The seat of Charlie Cartaret&rsquo;s emotions
furnishes a case in point.</p>

<p>Cartaret had resolved never to tell Vitoria that
he loved her, and he told her. Similarly, when
he told her, he sought to make it clear to her, quite
sincerely, that he nursed no hope of winning her
for his wife, and, now that she was gone, hope
took possession of his breast and brought with it
determination. Why not? Had she not amazingly
confessed her love for him? That left him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>193]</a></span>
as he saw it, no reason for abnegation; it made
sacrifice wrong for them both. The secret difficulty
at which she hinted became something that
it was now as much his duty, as it was his highest
desire, to remove. For the rest, though he could
now no more than previously consider offering her
a union with a man condemned to a lifelong
poverty, there remained for him no task save the
simple one of acquiring affluence. What could
seem easier&mdash;for a young man in love?</p>

<p>The more he thought about it, the more obvious
his course became. During all his boyhood, art
had been his single passion; during all his residence
in Paris he had flung the best that was in
him upon the altar of his artistic ambition; but
now, without a single pang of regret, he resolved
to give up art forever. He would see Vitoria on
the morrow and come to a practical understanding
with her: was he not always a practical man?
Then he would reopen negotiation with his uncle
and ask for a place in the elder Cartaret&rsquo;s business.
Perhaps it would not even be necessary for him
to return to America: he had the brilliant idea that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>194]</a></span>
his uncle&rsquo;s business&mdash;which was to say, the great
monopoly of which his uncle&rsquo;s holdings were a
small part&mdash;had never been properly &ldquo;pushed&rdquo;
in France, and that Charles Cartaret was the man
of all men to push it. The mystery that dear
Vitoria made of some private obstacle? That, of
course, was but the exaggeration of a sensitive
girl; it was the long effect of some parental command
or childish vow. He had only to wrest
from her the statement of it in order to prove it so.
It was some unpractical fancy wholly beneath the
regard of a practical, and now wholly assured,
man of affairs.</p>

<p>By way of beginning a conservative business-career,
Charlie went to the front window and, as
he had done one day not long since, emptied his
pockets for the delight of the hurdy-gurdy grinder.
Then, singing under his breath, and inwardly
blessing every pair of lovers that he passed, he
went out for a long walk in the twilight.</p>

<p>He walked along the Quai D&rsquo;Orsay, beside
which the crowded little passenger-steamers were
tearing the silver waters of the Seine; crossed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>195]</a></span>
white Pont de l&rsquo;Alma; struck through the Trocadero
gardens, and so, by the rue de Passy and
the shaded Avenue Ingrez, came to the railway
bridge, crossed it and strolled along the All&eacute;e des
Fortifications. He walked until the night overtook
him, and only then turned back through
Auteuil and over the Pont Grenelle toward home.</p>

<p>Alike in the perfumed shadows beneath the
trees and under the yellow lamps of the Boulevard
de Mont Parnasse, he walked upon the clouds of
resolution. The city that has in her tender keeping
the dust of many lovers, cradled him and
drew him forward. Her soft breath fanned his
cheek, her sweet voice whispered in his ears:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trust me and obey me! Did I not know and
shelter Gabrielle d&rsquo;Estr&eacute;es and her royal suitor?
Have I not had a care for De Musset and for
Heine? In that walled garden over there, Balzac
dreamed of Mme. Hanska. Along this street
Chopin wandered with George Sand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That whisper followed him to his room, still
thrilling with Vitoria&rsquo;s visit. It charmed him
into a wonderful sense of her nearness, into a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>196]</a></span>
belief that he was keeping ward over her as long
as he sat by his windows and watched the stars
go down and the pink dawn climb the eastern
sky. It lulled him at last to sleep with his head
upon his arms and his arms upon the mottled
table.</p>

<p>He overslept. It must have been nearly noon
when he woke, and then he was wakened only by
a pounding at the door of his room. Fat Mme.
Refrogn&eacute; had brought him a cable-message. When
she had gone, he opened it, surprised at once by its
extravagant length. It was from Cora; a modern
miracle had happened: there was oil in the black
keeping of the plot of ground that only sentiment
had so long bade them retain in the little
Ohio town. Cartaret was rich....</p>


<p class="break">When the first force of the shock was over,
when he could realize, in some small measure, what
that message meant to him, Cartaret&rsquo;s earliest
thought was of the Lady of the Rose. Holding
the bit of paper as tightly as if it were itself his
riches and wanted to fly away on the wings that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>197]</a></span>
had brought it, he staggered, like a drunken man,
to the door of the Room Opposite.</p>

<p>He knocked, but received no answer. A clock
struck mid-day. Vitoria had probably gone to
her class, and Chitta to her marketing.</p>

<p>A mad impulse to spread the good news possessed
him. It was as if telling the news were
recording a deed that there was only a brief time
to record: he must do it at once in order to secure
title. He knew that his friends, if they were in
funds, would soon be gathered at the Caf&eacute; Des
Deux Colombes.</p>

<p>When he passed the rue St. Andr&eacute; Des Arts, he
remembered Fourget. Cartaret was ashamed that
his memory had been so tardy. Fourget had
helped him in his heavy need; Fourget should be
the first to know of his affluence....</p>

<p>The old dealer, his bushy brows drawn tight together,
his spectacles gleaming, was trying to say
&ldquo;No&rdquo; to a lad with a picture under his arm&mdash;a
crestfallen lad that was a stranger to Cartaret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see the picture,&rdquo; said Cartaret, without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>198]</a></span>
further preface. He put out a ready hand.</p>

<p>The boy blushed. Cartaret had been abrupt and
did not present the appearance of a possible purchaser.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please,&rdquo; urged Cartaret. &ldquo;I may care
to buy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fourget gaped. The boy turned up his canvas&mdash;an
execrable daub.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy that,&rdquo; said Cartaret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you mad?&rdquo; asked Fourget.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring back that picture to M. Fourget in half
an hour,&rdquo; pursued the heedless American, &ldquo;and he
will give you for it two hundred francs that he
will have lent me and that I shall have left with
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He pushed the stammering lad out of the shop
and turned to Fourget.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you drunk?&rdquo; asked the dealer, changing
the form of his suspicions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fourget,&rdquo; cried Cartaret, clapping his friend
on the back, &ldquo;I shall never be hungry again&mdash;never&mdash;never&mdash;never!
Look at that.&rdquo; He produced
the precious cable-message. &ldquo;That piece of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>199]</a></span>
paper will feed me all my life long. It will buy me
houses, horses, motors, steamship-tickets. It looks
like paper, Fourget.&rdquo; He spread it under Fourget&rsquo;s
nose. &ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t; it&rsquo;s a dozen suits of
clothes a year; it&rsquo;s a watch-and-chain, a diamond
scarf-pin (if I&rsquo;d wear one!); it&rsquo;s a yacht. It&rsquo;s
an oil-well, Fourget&mdash;and a godsend!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fourget took it in his blue-veined hands. His
hands trembled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I forgot,&rdquo; said Cartaret. &ldquo;It is in English.
Let me translate.&rdquo; He translated.</p>

<p>When Charlie looked up from his reading, he
found Fourget busily engaged in polishing his
spectacles. Perhaps the old man&rsquo;s eyes were weak
and could not bear to be without their glasses:
they certainly were moist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not see so well as I once saw,&rdquo; the dealer
was explaining: his voice was very gruff indeed.
&ldquo;You are wholly certain that this is no trick which
one plays upon you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret was wholly certain.</p>

<p>Fourget made a valiant attempt at expressing
his congratulations in a mere Anglo-Saxon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>200]</a></span>
handshake. He found it quite inadequate, and this
annoyed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The world,&rdquo; he growled, &ldquo;loses a possibly fair
artist and gets an idle millionaire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You get a new shop,&rdquo; vowed Cartaret. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
shake your head! I&rsquo;ll make it a business proposition:
I&rsquo;ve had enough trouble by being suspected
of charity. I&rsquo;m going to buy an interest, and I
shan&rsquo;t want my money sunk in anything dark
and unsanitary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fourget shook his gray head again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you with all my heart, my friend,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;but no. This little shop meets my little
needs and will last out my little remaining days.
I would not leave it for the largest establishment
on the boulevards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They talked until Cartaret again bethought him
of the caf&eacute; in the rue Jacob.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you will lend me the two hundred francs,&rdquo;
he asked, &ldquo;and give it to that boy for his picture?&rdquo;
How much a boy that boy seemed now: he was
just the boy that Cartaret had been in the long
ago time that was yesterday!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>201]</a></span>
&ldquo;Since you insist; but truly, my dear monsieur,
myself I was about to weaken and purchase the
terrible thing when you interrupted and saved
me.&rdquo; ...</p>

<p>The money from Seraphin&rsquo;s latest <i>magnum opus</i>
not being yet exhausted, Seraphin&rsquo;s friends were
lunching at the Caf&eacute; Des Deux Colombes, with
little Pasbeaucoup fluttering between them and
the kitchen, and Madame, expressionless under
her mountain of hair, stuffed into the wire cage
and bulging out of it. The company rose when
they espied Cartaret, the cadaverous poet Garnier
picking up his plate of roast chicken so as not to
lose, in his welcoming, time that might be given
to eating.</p>

<p>Cartaret felt at first somewhat ashamed before
them. He felt the contrast between his changed
fortunes and their fortunes unchanged. At last,
however, the truth escaped him, and then he felt
more ashamed than ever, so unenvious were the
congratulations that they poured upon him.</p>

<p>Devignes&rsquo; round belly shook with delight.
Garnier even stopped eating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>202]</a></span>
&ldquo;Now you may have the leisure for serious
work, which,&rdquo; squeaked Varachon through his
broken nose, &ldquo;your art has so badly needed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seraphin said nothing, but put his hand on
Cartaret&rsquo;s shoulder and gripped it hard.</p>

<p>Houdon embraced the fortunate one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I not always tell you?&rdquo; he demanded of
Seraphin. &ldquo;Did I not say he was a disguised
millionaire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he has but now got his money,&rdquo; Seraphin
protested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poof!&rdquo; said Houdon, dismissing the argument
with a trill upon his invisible piano. &ldquo;La-la-la!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Without doubt to mark the event you will
give a dinner?&rdquo; suggested Garnier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Without doubt,&rdquo; said Houdon.</p>

<p>Cartaret said that he would give a dinner that
very evening if Pasbeaucoup would strain the
Median laws of the establishment so far as to
trust him for a few days, and Pasbeaucoup, receiving
the necessary nod from Madame, said that
they would be but too happy to trust M.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>203]</a></span>
Cartarette for any sum and for any length of time
that he might choose to name.</p>

<p>So Cartaret left them for a few hours and went
back to his room at the earliest possible moment
for finding Vitoria returned from her class. This
time he not only knocked: he tried, in his haste,
the knob of the door, and the door, swinging open,
revealed an empty room, stripped of even its
furniture.</p>

<p>He nearly fell downstairs to the cave of
Refrogn&eacute;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

<p>Had monsieur again been missing strawberries?
Where were what?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Mlle. Urola&mdash;where are the occupants
of the room across from mine?&rdquo; Cartaret&rsquo;s
frenzied tones implied that he would hold the
concierge personally responsible for whatever
might have happened to his neighbors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Likely they are occupying some other room by
this time,&rdquo; growled Refrogn&eacute;. &ldquo;I was unaware
that they were such great friends of monsieur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are. Where are they?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>204]</a></span>
&ldquo;In that case, they must have told monsieur of
their contemplated departure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean they&rsquo;ve moved to another room
in this house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But no.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then where have they gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had gone away. They had paid their
bill honestly, even the rent for the unconsumed
portion of the month, and gone away. That was
all it was an honest concierge&rsquo;s business to know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did they go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Early this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t they leave any address?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None. Why should they? Mademoiselle
never received letters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret could bear no more. Even the man
that hauled away the furniture had only taken it
to the shop from which it had been leased.
Refrogn&eacute; had seen the two women get into a cab
with their scanty luggage and had heard them order
themselves driven to the Gare d&rsquo;Orsay. That
was the end of the trail....</p>


<p class="break"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>205]</a></span>
Cartaret climbed to his own room. Thrust
under the door, where he had missed it in the rush
of his hopeful exit that morning, was an envelope.
It did not hold the expected note of explanation.
It held only a pressed rose, yellow now, and dry
and odorless.</p>



<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>206]</a></span></p>

<span class="vsmlfont">NARRATING HOW CARTARET BEGAN HIS QUEST OF
THE ROSE</span></h2>

</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>For a great while Cartaret remained as a man
stunned. It was only very slowly that there
came to him the full realization of his loss, and
then it came with all the agony with which a return
to life is said to come to one narrowly saved
from death by drowning.</p>

<p>Blindly his brain bashed itself against the
mysterious wall of Vitoria&rsquo;s flight. Why had she
gone? Where had she gone? Why had she left
no word? A thousand times that day these unanswerable
questions whirled through his dizzy
consciousness. Had he offended her? He had
explained his one offense, and she had given no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>207]</a></span>
sign of having taken any other hurt. Was she indeed
a revolutionist from some strange country,
summoned away, without a moment&rsquo;s warning,
by the inner council of her party? Revolutionist
conspirators did not go to art-classes and do not
walk only under the chaperonage of an ancient
duenna. Was she, then, that claimant to power
that he had once imagined her, now gone to seize
her rights? Things of that sort did not, Cartaret
knew, occur in these prosy days. Then why had
she gone, and where, and why had she left no
word for him? Again these dreary questions
began their circle.</p>

<p>Less than twenty-four hours ago, he had
thought that money would resolve all his troubles.
Money! Fervently he wished himself poor again&mdash;poor
again, as yesterday, with Her across the
landing in the Room Opposite.</p>

<p>Somehow, he did not forget his friends and the
dinner he had promised them. He went to the
Deux Colombes and ordered the dinner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say to them, Pasbeaucoup,&rdquo; he gave instructions,
&ldquo;that I am indisposed and shall not be able
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>208]</a></span>
to dine with them. Say that we shall all dine together
some other night&mdash;very soon I hope. Say
that I am sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was bitter now against all the world.
&ldquo;What will they care, as long as they have the
dinner?&rdquo; he reflected.</p>

<p>Pasbeaucoup cared. He expressed great concern
for monsieur&rsquo;s health.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; thought Cartaret, &ldquo;is because I&rsquo;m rich.
A month or two ago and they wouldn&rsquo;t trust me:
they&rsquo;d have let me starve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went back to his desolate room and to his
dreary questioning. He was there, with his head
in his hands, when Seraphin found him.</p>

<p>Seraphin&rsquo;s suit was still new, and it was evident
that he had dressed carefully his twin wisps of
whisker in honor of Cartaret&rsquo;s celebration. The
Frenchman&rsquo;s face was grave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you dining?&rdquo; sneered Cartaret.</p>

<p>Seraphin passed by the sneer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They told me that you were ill,&rdquo; he said,
simply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you came to see if it was true?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>209]</a></span>
&ldquo;I came to see if I could be of any assistance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; ran Cartaret&rsquo;s unjust thoughts, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s very
evident you&rsquo;re rich now, Charlie!&rdquo;)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody else came with you,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Seraphin hesitated. He twirled his soft hat in
his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They thought&mdash;all but Houdon, who still persists
that you have been rich always&mdash;they thought
that, now that you were rich, you might prefer
other society.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>You</em> didn&rsquo;t think it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was said so frankly that even Cartaret&rsquo;s present
mood could not resist its sincerity. Charlie
frowned and put both his hands on Seraphin&rsquo;s
shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dieudonn&eacute;,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feared it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not money-trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feared that it was not money-trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You understood?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guessed. You have been so happy of late,
while you were so poor, that to absent yourself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>210]</a></span>
from this gayety when you were rich&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; An expressive
gesture finished the sentence. &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo;
added Seraphin, &ldquo;one cannot be happy long, and
when you told me that you had money, I feared
that you would lose something else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret wrung the hand of his friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go back,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Go back and tell them
that it&rsquo;s not pride. Tell them it&rsquo;s illness. I <em>am</em>
ill. It was good of you to come here, but there&rsquo;s
nothing you can do just now. To-morrow, or
next day, perhaps I can talk to you about it.
Perhaps. But not now. I couldn&rsquo;t talk to any
one now. Good-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sat down again&mdash;sat silent for many hours
after he had heard Seraphin&rsquo;s footsteps die away
down the stairs. He heard the hurdy-gurdy and
thought that he could not bear it. He heard the
other lodgers return. He heard the strange sounds&mdash;the
creaking boards, the complaining stairway,
the whispering of curtains&mdash;which are the night-sounds
of every house. In the ear of his mind,
he heard the voices of his distant guests:</p>

<div class="cpoem2">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>211]</a></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;What woman&rsquo;s lips compare to this:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This sturdy seidel&rsquo;s frothy kiss?&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Because he grew afraid of the ghosts of doubt
that haunt the darkness, he lighted his lamp;
but for a long time the ghosts remained.</p>

<p>This was the very room in which he had told
her that he loved her; this desert place was once
the garden in which he had said that little of
what was so much. She had stood by that table
(so shabby now!) and made it a wonderful thing.
She had touched that curtain; her fingers, at parting,
had held that rattling handle of the shattered
door. He half thought that the door might open
and reveal her, even now. Memory joined hands
with love to make her poignantly present. Her
lightest word, her least action: his mind retained
them and rehearsed them every one. The music
of her laughter, the melody of her grace, wove
spells in the lamplit room; but they ceased as
she had ceased; they left the song unfinished, they
stopped in the middle of a bar.</p>

<p>He wondered whether it must always remain
unfinished, this allegro of love in what, without it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>212]</a></span>
would be the dull biographic symphony of his
life; whether he would grow to be an old man
with no memories but broken memories to warm
his heart; and whether even this memory would
become as the mere memory of a beautiful portrait
seen in youth, a Ghirlandaio&rsquo;s or a Guido
Reni&rsquo;s work, some other man&rsquo;s vision, a part of
the whole world&rsquo;s rich heritage, a portion of the
eternal riddle of existence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So short a time ago,&rdquo; crooned the ghosts&mdash;&ldquo;and
doubtless she has already forgotten you.
You have but touched her hands: how could you
hope that you had touched her heart? She will
be happy, though she knows that you are unhappy;
glad, though you are desolate. You gave
her your dreams to keep, your hopes, your faith
in love and womankind: and this is what she did
with them! They are withered like that rose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had put the yellow thing against his heart,
where once he had put it when it was fresh and
pure. He drew it out now and looked at it. What
did it mean&mdash;that message of the rose? That,
as she had once treasured the flower, so now she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>213]</a></span>
would treasure in its place her memory of him?</p>

<p>&ldquo;It means,&rdquo; chanted the ghosts, &ldquo;that her
friendship is as dead as this dry flower!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Did it? He would make one trial more.</p>

<p>Vivid as was her face in his mind, he brought
to the lamp his pictures of her. She had liked
those pictures; in spite of herself, she had shown
him that she liked them&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>(The ghosts were crooning:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Though you had the brush of Diego Velasquez,
she would not heed you now!&rdquo;)</p>

<p>Had he painted her&mdash;he had tried to&mdash;as she
should have been? Or had he painted her as she
really was?</p>

<p>He searched the pictures. Her eyes seemed to
look at him with a long farewell in their blue-black
depths, the parted lips to tremble on a sob.
A light was born in the canvas&mdash;the reflected light
of his own high faith revived. Whatever separated
them, it was by no will of hers. No, there was
no ghost in all the fields of night that he would
listen to again: in that pictured face there was as
much of pride as there was of beauty, but there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>214]</a></span>
was nothing of either cruelty or deceit. Yes, he
had only touched her hand, but certainly hand had
never yet touched hand as his touched hers. He
was sure of it and sure of her. A short acquaintance&mdash;it
had been long enough to prove her. A few
broken words in the twilight&mdash;they were volumes.
The merest breath of feeling&mdash;it would last them
to their graves.</p>

<p>He would move earth and Heaven to find
Vitoria: the wine of that resolution rang in his
ears and fired his heart. The sun, coming up
over the Panth&eacute;on in a glory of red and gold, sent
into Cartaret&rsquo;s room a shining messenger of royal
encouragement before whose sword the ghosts
forever fled. The lover was almost gay again:
here was new service for her; here, for him, was
work, the best surcease of sorrow. He felt like
an athlete trained to the minute and crouching
for the starter&rsquo;s pistol-shot. He believed in
Vitoria! He believed in her, and so he could not
doubt his own ability to discover her in the face
of all hardships and to win her against all odds;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>215]</a></span>
he believed in her and in himself, and so he could
not doubt God.</p>

<p>He understood something of the difficulties that
presented themselves. He knew scarcely anything
of the woman whom he sought; his only clews
were her name and the name of the rose; he must
first find to what country those names belonged,
and to find that country he might have to seek
through all the world. He could not ask help of
the police; he would not summon to his assistance
those vile rats who call themselves private-detectives.
It was a task for himself alone; it was a
task that must occupy his every working-hour; but
it was a task that he would accomplish.</p>

<p>A second cable-message interrupted him at his
ablutions. It was from his uncle, and it read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Cora wires me received no reply from you. Do you
accept trust&rsquo;s offer stated in her cable? Advise you say
yes. Better come home and attend to business.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>This brought Cartaret to the realization that
he was in a paradoxical position: he was a penniless
millionaire. He went to Fourget&rsquo;s and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>216]</a></span>
borrowed some money. Thence he went to the cable-office
in the Avenue de l&rsquo;Opera. There had been,
he now recalled, an offer&mdash;a really dazzling offer&mdash;mentioned
in his sister&rsquo;s message; but more
practical matters had driven it from his mind. He
therefore sent his uncle this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;I accept trust&rsquo;s offer. Advise Cora to agree. Don&rsquo;t
worry: New York&rsquo;s not the only place for business.
There&rsquo;s business in Paris&mdash;lots of it.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>His uncle had been very annoying: Charlie
should have been at work at the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale
a full half-hour ago. He had resolved
to begin with the floral clew.</p>

<p>He went there immediately and asked what
books they had about flowers; they told him that
they had many thousand. Cartaret narrowed his
field; he said what he wanted was a book on roses,
and he was told that he might choose any of
hundreds that were at hand. In despair, he ordered
brought to him any one that began with an
&ldquo;A&rdquo;; he would work through the alphabet.</p>

<p>By closing-time he had reached &ldquo;Ac.&rdquo; He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>217]</a></span>
hurried out into the fresh breeze that blew down
through the public square and the narrow rue
Colbert, and so cut across to the cable-office.</p>

<p>He wanted to send a message mentioning a little
matter he had forgotten that morning. As it
happened, the operator had just received a message
for Charlie. It was again from his uncle,
and said that the sale would be consummated
early next day. There was about it a brevity
more severe than even cables require: the elder
Cartaret patently disapproved of the communication
that his nephew had sent him. Still, the
sale seemed to be assured, and that was the main
thing, so Charlie put the word &ldquo;Five&rdquo; in place
of the word &ldquo;One&rdquo; in the message he was drafting,
and sent it off:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Cable me five thousand.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>He interrupted his library-researches the next
day to make a sporadic raid upon florist-shops
along the boulevards, but found no florist that
had ever heard of the Azure Rose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>218]</a></span>
The answer to his latest cable-message came
the next day at noon. He had resumed his search
at the Biblioth&egrave;que and instructed the cable-clerk
to hold all messages until he should call for them.
He called for this at lunch-time:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Sale completed, thanks to power-of-attorney you left
me when sailing. Do you mean dollars?&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Cartaret groaned at this procrastination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And my uncle brags of his American hustle!&rdquo;
he cried.</p>

<p>He filed his reply:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Of course I meant dollars. What did you suppose
I meant? Francs? Pounds sterling? I mean dollars.
Hurry!&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Be sure to put in the punctuation marks,&rdquo; he
admonished the pretty clerk.</p>

<p>He dashed back to the library. During the
next hundred and twenty hours, he divided his
time between botanical researches and one side
of the following cable-conversation:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come home.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>219]</a></span>
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Busy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Botanizing. But if you don&rsquo;t send me immediately
that little bit of all that belongs to me,
I&rsquo;ll knock off work to find out the reason why.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The money arrived just as his credit in short-credit
Paris was everywhere close to the breaking-point,
and just as he gave up hope of ever finding
what he wanted at the great library, where he had
driven every sub and deputy librarian to the brink
of insanity. Money, however, brings resourcefulness:
Cartaret then remembered the Jardin des
Plantes, where he had once been with Vitoria.</p>

<p>No official knew anything about the Azure
Rose, but an old gardener (Cartaret was trying
them all) gave him hope. He was a little Gascon,
that gardener, with white hair and blue eyes, and
his long labor had bent him forward, as if the
earth in which he worked had one day laid hold of
his shoulders and never since let go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had a brother once who was a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fain&eacute;ant</i> and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>220]</a></span>
so a great traveler. He spoke of such a rose,&rdquo; the
Gascon nodded; &ldquo;but I cannot remember what
it was that he told me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here are five francs to help you remember,&rdquo;
said Cartaret.</p>

<p>The old man took the money and thanked him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I cannot remember what my brother told
me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;except that the rose was found
nowhere but in the Basque provinces of Spain.&rdquo; ...</p>

<p>A half-hour later Cartaret had bought his traveling-kit,
which included a forty-five caliber automatic
revolver. Forty minutes later he had paid
Refrogn&eacute; ten months&rsquo; rent in advance, together
with a twenty-five franc tip, and directed that his
room be held against his return. An hour later he
was sheepishly handing Seraphin a bulky package,
evidently containing certain canvases, and saying
to him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are something I wouldn&rsquo;t leave about
and couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to store, and you&rsquo;re&mdash;well,
I think you&rsquo;ll understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At twelve o&rsquo;clock that night, from an opened
window in his compartment of a sleeping-car on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>221]</a></span>
a southward-speeding <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">train de luxe</i>, Cartaret was
looking up at the yellow stars somewhere about
Tours.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night, Vitoria!&rdquo; he was whispering.
&ldquo;Good-night, and&mdash;God keep you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was a very practical man.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<br />
<span class="vsmlfont">FURTHER ADVENTURES OF AN AMATEUR BOTANIST</span></h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The happiness of the good old times is a mere dream
in every age; but to keep on the laws of the old times,
in preserving to reform, in reforming to preserve, is
the true life of a free people.&mdash;Freeman:
<i>The Norman Conquest</i>.</p>
</div>


<p>&ldquo;Vitoria,&rdquo; explained the guard, whom Cartaret
inveigled into conversation next morning,
&ldquo;is the capital of the province of Alava.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; said Cartaret. &ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s more than
one Vitoria, my friend. If I&rsquo;d only studied geography
when I was at school, it might have saved
me a week now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He tried to make talk with a hatless Englishman
in tweeds, who was smoking a briar-pipe in
the corridor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vitoria,&rdquo; said the Englishman, &ldquo;is one of the
places where Wellington beat the French under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>223]</a></span>
Joseph Buonaparte and Jourdan, in the Peninsular
War.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t the Spanish help?&rdquo; asked Cartaret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They thought they did,&rdquo; said the Englishman.</p>

<p>Cartaret had had small time in Paris to learn
anything about the strange people and the strange
country for which he was bound; but, had he
had weeks for study, he would have learned little
more. Centuries had availed almost nothing
to the scholars that sought to explain them. The
origin of their race and language still unknown,
the Basques, proud and wild, free and self-sufficient,
have held to themselves their sea and mountain-fortresses
from the dawn of recorded history.
The successive tides of the Suavi, the Franks and
the Goths have swept through those rugged valleys,
and left the Basque unmixed and untainted.
From the days of the Roman legions to those
of the Napoleonic armies, he has withstood the
onslaughts of every conqueror of Western Europe,
unconquered and unchanged. The rivers of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>224]</a></span>
legends draw direct from the source of all
legends; the boundary of his customs is as unalterable
as the foundation of his Pyrenees. The
engines of imperial slaughter, the steady blows
of progress, the erosion of time itself, have left
him as they found him: the serene despair of the
philologist, the Sphynx of ethnology, the riddle
of the races of mankind.</p>

<p>Cartaret picked up the scanty threads of the
Basques&rsquo; known chronicle. He learned that these
Celtiberi had preserved an independence which
outlasted the Western Empire, gave no more than
a nominal allegiance to Leovigild, to Wamba
and to Charlemagne, cast their fortunes with the
Moors at Roncesvalles and, in the eleventh century,
formed a free confederation of three separate
republics under a ruler of their own blood and
choice, whose tenure was dependent upon constitutional
guarantees and whose power was wholly
executive. Even the yoke of Spain, hated as it
was, had failed materially to affect this form of
government and could be justly regarded as little
save a name. The three provinces&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>225]</a></span>
Vascongadas as they were called: the sea-coast Viscaza
and Guipuzcoa and the inland Alava&mdash;retained
their ancient identity. Somewhere among their
swift rivers and well-nigh inaccessible mountains
must be the house of her whom he sought. Because
of the name that she had given him, Cartaret
headed now for Vitoria.</p>

<p>Twice he had to change his train, each time for
a worse. From Bayonne he crossed the Spanish
border at Hendaya, whence the railway, after running
west along the rocky coast of the Bay of Biscay,
turned southward toward the heights about
Tolosa. All afternoon the scenery was varied and
romantic. The hard-clay soil, cultivated with
painful care by young giants and graceful
amazons, gave place to pine-forests, to tree-cloaked
hills, to mountains dark with mystery.</p>

<p>Twilight fell, then night. Cartaret could now
see nothing of the landscape through which he
was jolted, but, from the puffing of the engine,
the slow advance, the frightful swinging about
curves, it was clear to him that he was being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>226]</a></span>
hauled, in a series of half-circles, up long and
steep ascents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What station is this?&rdquo; he asked a French-speaking
guard that passed his window at a stop
where the air was cool and sweet with the odor
of pine. The lantern showed only a good-natured
face in a world of darkness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ormaiztegua, monsieur,&rdquo; said the guard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Cartaret. &ldquo;Say it slow, please,
and say it plainly: I am a stranger and of tender
years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The guard repeated that outlandish name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now which way do we go?&rdquo; Cartaret inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;North again to Zumarraga.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;North again?&rdquo; repeated Cartaret. &ldquo;Look
here: I&rsquo;m in a hurry. Isn&rsquo;t there any more direct
route to Vitoria?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Evidently monsieur does not know the Pyrenees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From Zumarraga, the train bent yet again southward,
out of Guipuzcoa across the Navarra line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we late?&rdquo; asked Cartaret.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>227]</a></span>
&ldquo;But a little,&rdquo; the guard reassured him:
&ldquo;scarcely two hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last, when they had climbed that precipitous
spur of the Pyrenees which forms the northern
wall of Alava; after they had stopped once to
harness an extra locomotive, and stopped again to
unharness it; after they had descended again, ascended
again and once more descended&mdash;this last
time for what seemed but a little way&mdash;the train
came to the end of this stage of Cartaret&rsquo;s journey.
He alighted on a smoky platform only partially
illuminated by more smoky lamps and had himself
driven to the hotel that the first accessible
cabby recommended.</p>

<p>Vitoria is a curious city of nearly 150,000 inhabitants,
situated on a hill overlooking the Plain
of Alava. Cartaret, waking with the sun, could
see from his window the Campillo, the oldest portion
of the town, crowning the hill-crest, an almost
deserted jumble of ruined walls and ancient
towers, surrounded by public-gardens and topped
by the twelfth-century Cathedral of St. Mary,
the effect of its Gothic arches sadly lessened by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>228]</a></span>
ugly modern additions to the pile. Below, the
Vitoria Antigua clung to the hillside, a maze of
narrow, twisting streets; and still lower lay the
new town, a place of wide thoroughfares and
shady walks, among which was Cartaret&rsquo;s hotel.</p>

<p>He breakfasted early and, having no leisure for
sight-seeing, asked his way to the city&rsquo;s administrative-offices.
He passed rows of hardware-factories,
wine and wool warehouses, paper-mills
and tanneries, wide yards in which rows of
earthenware lay drying, and plazas where the
horse and mule trade flourished, and so came at
last to the arcaded market-place opposite which
was the building that he was in search of; the offices
were not yet open for the day.</p>

<p>He sat down to wait at a table under an awning
and before a caf&eacute; that faced the market. The
market was full of country-folk, men and women,
all of great height and splendid physique, and
Cartaret saw at once that the latter wore the same
sort of peculiar head-dress that, in Paris, had distinguished
Chitta.</p>

<p>A loquacious waiter, wholly unintelligible, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>229]</a></span>
accosting him. Cartaret, guessing that he was
expected to pay for his chair with an order for
drink, made signs to fit that conjecture, and the
waiter brought him a flask of the native <i lang="eu" xml:lang="eu">chacoli</i>.
It was a poor wine, and Cartaret did not care for
it, but he sat on, pretending to, watching the white
municipal building and looking, from time to time,
at the farmers from the market who passed into
the caf&eacute; and out of it.</p>

<p>He half expected to see Chitta among their
womenfolk: Chitta, of whom he would so lately
have said that he never wanted to see her again!
The farmers all gravely bowed to him, and Cartaret,
of course, bowed in return. Finally it occurred
to him that he might get news from one
of them and so, one by one, he would stop them
with an inquiry as to whether they spoke French.
A dozen failures were convincing him of his folly,
when their result was ruined by the appearance
of a rosy-cheeked young man in a wide hat and
swathed legs, who appeared to be more prosperous
than his neighbors and who replied to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>230]</a></span>
Cartaret in a French that the American could understand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then do sit down and have a drink with me,&rdquo;
urged Cartaret. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a stranger here and I&rsquo;d be
greatly obliged to you if you would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man agreed. He explained complacently
that the folk of Alava, though invariably
hospitable, generally distrusted strangers,
but that he had had advantages, having been sent
to the Jesuit school in St. Jean Pied-de-Port. He
was the one chance in a thousand: he knew something
of what Cartaret wanted to learn.</p>

<p>Had he ever heard of a rose, a white rose, called
the Azure Rose?</p>

<p>Had he not heard! It was one of the foolish
superstitions of the folk of Northern Alava, that
rose. His own mother, being from the North&mdash;God
rest her soul&mdash;had not been exempt: when he
was sent into France to school, she had pinned
an Azure Rose against his heart in order to insure
his return home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it grows in the North?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the most part, yes, monsieur, and even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>231]</a></span>
there it is something rare: that, without doubt, is
why it is esteemed so dearly by the common folk.
It grows only near the snows, the high snows.
There are but few white peaks there, and on them
a few such roses. The country beyond Alegria
is the place of all places for them. If monsieur
wants to find the Azure Rose, he should go to the
wild country beyond Alegria.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know that country?&rdquo; asked Cartaret.</p>

<p>The young man shrugged. He ought to know
it: he had been brought up there. But it was no
place for strangers; it was very wild.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Cartaret, hope shining in his
brown eyes&mdash;&ldquo;I wonder if you ever heard of a
family there by the name of Urola?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The farmer shook his head. Urola? No, he
had never heard of Urola. But stay: there was
the great family, the Ethenard-Eskurola d&rsquo;Alegria.
Eskurola was somewhat like Urola; indeed,
Urola was part of Eskurola. Perhaps, monsieur&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Cartaret was leaning far over the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>232]</a></span>
&ldquo;Is there,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;a young lady in that
family named Vitoria?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The farmer reflected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was one daughter,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;a little
girl when I was a lad. She was the Lady Dolorez.
She had, however, many names: people of great
houses among us have many names, monsieur, and
Vitoria is not uncommonly among them. Vitoria?
Yes, I think she was also called Vitoria.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she speak English?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was likely, monsieur.&rdquo; Nearly all of the
Ethenard-Eskurolas spoke English, because one
of their so numerous ancestors was the great Don
Miguel Ricardo d&rsquo;Alava, general under the Duke
of Wellington, who valued him above all his generals
in that Spanish campaign. Since then there
had always been English teachers for the children
of the house. So much was common knowledge.</p>

<p>It was enough for Cartaret. Within the hour
he was summoning the proprietor of his hotel to
his assistance in arranging for an expedition to
Alegria.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>233]</a></span>
The hotel proprietor stroked a beard so bristling
as to threaten his caressing fingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a wild country,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they all say,&rdquo; returned Cartaret.
&ldquo;When does the next train leave for it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no train. Alegria is a little town
in the high Cantabrian Mountains, far from any
train.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then come along downtown and help me buy
a horse,&rdquo; said Cartaret. &ldquo;I saw a lot of likely-looking
ones this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, monsieur,&rdquo; expostulated the hotel proprietor,
&ldquo;nobody between here and Alegria speaks
French. Nobody in Alegria speaks French&mdash;and
you do not speak <i lang="eu" xml:lang="eu">Eskura</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is how we Basques name our own tongue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t care. Get me a guide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear I cannot, monsieur. The country people
do not want Alava to become the prey of tourists,
and they will be slow to allow a stranger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you got a road-map?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, the proprietor had a road-map&mdash;of sorts.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>234]</a></span>
It looked faulty, and Cartaret found later that
it was more faulty than it looked; but he resolved
to make it do, and that afternoon found
him in the saddle of a lean and hardy mare, ten
miles on his way. He had brought with him a
pair of English riding-breeches and leggings&mdash;purchased
in Paris for no other reason than that
he had the money and used to love to ride&mdash;his
reduced equipment was in saddle-bags, and the
road-map in his handiest pocket.</p>

<p>He put up at a little inn that night and rode
hard, east by south, all the next day. He rode
through fertile valleys where the fields were already
yellow with wheat and barley. He came
upon patches of Indian corn that made him think
of the country about his own Ohio home, and
upon flax-fields and fields of hemp. His way lay
steadily upward, and in the hills he met with
iron-banks and some lead and copper mines.
Queerly costumed peasants herded sheep and
goats along the roadside; but nobody that Cartaret
addressed could understand a word of his
speech. The road-map was bad, indeed: twice he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>235]</a></span>
lost his way by consulting it and once, he thought,
by failing to consult it. A road that the map informed
him would lead straight to Alegria ended
in a marble-quarry.</p>

<p>Cartaret accosted the only workman in sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alegria?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>The man pointed back the way that Cartaret
had come.</p>

<p>He followed the direction thus indicated and
took a turning that he had missed before. He
passed through a countryside of small plains.
Then he began to climb again and left these for
stretches of bare heath and hills covered with
furze. From one hilltop he looked ahead to a
vast pile of mountains crowned by two white
peaks that shone in the sun like the lances of a
celestial guard. The farms were less and less in
size and farther and farther apart&mdash;tiny farms
cultivated with antique implements. Apple-orchards
appeared and disappeared, and then, quite
suddenly, the hills became mountains, their bases
covered by great forests of straight chestnut-trees,
gigantic oaks and stately bushes whose limbs met
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>236]</a></span>
in a dark canopy above the rider&rsquo;s head. At his
approach, rabbits scurried, white tails erect, across
the road; from one rare clearing a flock of
partridges whirred skyward, and once, in the distance,
he saw a grazing herd of wild deer.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon, he came to a wide plateau,
surrounded on three sides with mountain-peaks.
There was a lake in the center, with a
few cottages scattered along its shores, and at
one end of the lake a high-gabled, wide-eaved
inn, in front of which a short man, dark and
wiry and unlike the people of that country,
lounged in the sun. He proved to be the innkeeper,
a native of Navarre, and, to Cartaret&rsquo;s
delight, spoke French.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he nodded, &ldquo;I learned it years ago from
a French servant that they used to have at the
castle in the old lord&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come from Vitoria,&rdquo; Cartaret explained.
&ldquo;Can you tell me how far it is to Alegria?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you have come from Vitoria,&rdquo; was the suspicious
answer, &ldquo;you must have taken the wrong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>237]</a></span>
road and come around Alegria. Alegria is a score
of miles behind you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret swore softly at that road-map. He
was tired and stiff, however, and so he dismounted
and let the landlord attend to his mare and bring
him, at the inn-porch, some black bread and
cheese and a small pitcher of <i lang="eu" xml:lang="eu">zaragua</i>, the native
cider.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are a strange people here,&rdquo; he said as
the landlord took a chair opposite.</p>

<p>The landlord shook his swarthy head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not speak ill of them,&rdquo; said he. His
tone implied that such a course would be unwise.
&ldquo;They call themselves,&rdquo; he went on after
a ruminative pause, &ldquo;the direct descendants of
those Celtiberi whom the old Romans could never
conquer, and I can well believe it of them. However,
I know nothing: the lord at the castle
knows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t like the Spaniards?&rdquo; asked Cartaret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They hate us,&rdquo; said the innkeeper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>238]</a></span>
&ldquo;I do not know. Perhaps because Spain rules
them&mdash;so much as any power could. But I know
nothing: the lord at the castle knows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The question fell thoughtlessly from the lips
of the American, but he had no sooner uttered it
than he surmised its answer:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Don Ricardo Ethenard-Eskurola d&rsquo;Alegria.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret produced a gold-piece and spun it on
the rude table before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An important man, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The innkeeper was eyeing the money, but his
reply was cautious:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;&lsquo;important&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rich?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The old lord lost much when there was the
great rising for Don Carlos. But an Ethenard-Eskurola
does not need riches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he&rsquo;s lucky. How does that happen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because his family is the most ancient and
powerful in all the Vascongadas. There is no
family older in Spain, nor any prouder.&rdquo; It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>239]</a></span>
plainly one subject of which this alien was permitted
to know something. &ldquo;They have been
lords of this land since before the time that men
made chronicles. The papers in the castle go
back to the Fifteenth Century&mdash;to the time when
<i lang="eu" xml:lang="eu">Eskura</i> was first turned into an alphabet. They
were at Roncesvalles; they made pilgrimages to
Jerusalem and fought in the crusades. One of
them was Lord-Lieutenant of Jerusalem when
Godfrey de Bouillon was its King. There was
an Ethenard-Eskurola at La Isla de los Faisanes
when the French Louis XI arranged there with
our Henry the marriage of the Duc de Guienne.
Always they have been lords and over-lords&mdash;always.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Cartaret. &ldquo;And the present lord
lives near here at the castle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As all his fathers lived before him. At their
place and in their manner. What they did, he
does; what they believed, he believes. Monsieur,
even the ancient Basque traditions of hospitality
are there a law infringeable. Were you his
bitterest blood-enemy and knocked at the castle-gate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>240]</a></span>
for a night&rsquo;s shelter, he himself, Ricardo
d&rsquo;Alegria, would greet you and wait upon you,
and keep you safe until morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then shoot my head off?&rdquo; suggested Cartaret.</p>

<p>The innkeeper smiled: &ldquo;I know nothing; but
the lord at the castle knows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose he hasn&rsquo;t a drop of any blood but
Basque blood in him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur, there is but one way in which a
foreigner may marry even the humblest Basque,
and that is by some act that saves the Basque&rsquo;s
entire line. Thus even the humblest. As for
the grandee at the castle, if I so much as asked
him that question, so proud is he of his nationality
and family that likely he would kill me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must be a pleasant neighbor,&rdquo; said the
American. &ldquo;He lives alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With his servants. He has, of course, many
servants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is not married?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still eyeing the gold-piece, the landlord answered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>241]</a></span>
&ldquo;No. There was something, once, long ago,
that men say&mdash;but I know nothing. The Don
Ricardo is the last of his house. Unless he marries,
the Eskurolas will cease. However, he will
marry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem certain of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naturally, monsieur. He will marry in order
that the Eskurolas do not cease.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes-s-s.&rdquo; Cartaret hesitated before his next
question. &ldquo;So he&rsquo;s alone up there? I mean&mdash;I
mean there&rsquo;s no other member of his family with
him now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instantly the innkeeper&rsquo;s face became blank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know nothing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the lord at the castle knows!&rdquo; interrupted
Cartaret. &ldquo;I said it first that time. The lord at
the castle must know everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He does,&rdquo; said the landlord simply.</p>

<p>Cartaret rose. He pushed the gold-piece across
the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That sentiment earns it,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Bring
my mare, please. And you might point out the
way to this castle. I&rsquo;ve a mind to run up there.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>242]</a></span>
The innkeeper looked at him oddly, but, when
the mare had been brought around, pointed a
lean brown finger across the lake toward the
mountains that ended in twin white peaks: the
peaks that Cartaret had seen a few hours since
and that now seemed to him to be the crests of
which he had dreamed when first he saw the Azure
Rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The road leads from the head of the lake,
monsieur,&rdquo; said the innkeeper: &ldquo;you cannot lose
your way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret followed the instructions thus conveyed.
After three miles&rsquo; riding, a curved ascent
had shut the lake and the cottages from view, had
shut from view every trace of human habitation.
He rode among scenery that, save for the grassy
bridle-path, was as wild as if it had never before
been known of man.</p>

<p>It was a ravishing country, a fairy-country of
blue skies and fleecy clouds; of acicular summits
and sharp-edged crags; of mist-hung valleys shimmering
in the sun; of black chasms dizzily bridged
by scarlet-flowered vines. The road ran along
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>243]</a></span>
the edges of precipices and wreathed the gray outcropping
rock; thick ropes of honeysuckle festooned
the limbs of ancient trees and perfumed
all the air. Here a blue cliff hid its distant face
behind a bridal-veil of descending spray, broken
by a dozen rainbows; there, down the terrifying
depths of a vertical wall, roared a white and
mighty cataract. The traveler&rsquo;s ears began to
listen for the song of the hamadryad from the
branches of the oak; his eyes to seek the flashing
limbs of a frightened nymph; here if anywhere
the gods of the elder-revelation still held sway.</p>

<p>Evening, which comes so suddenly in the Cantabrians,
was falling before the luxuriant verdure
lessened and he came to a break in the forest.
Below him, billow upon billow, the foothills fell
away in rolling waves of green. Above, the
jagged circle of the horizon was a line of salient
summits and tapering spires of every tint of blue&mdash;turquoise,
indigo, mauve&mdash;mounting up and
up like the seats in a Titanic amphitheater, to the
royal purple of the sky.</p>

<p>Cartaret had turned in his saddle to look at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>244]</a></span>
magnificent panorama. Now, turning forward,
he saw, rising ahead of him&mdash;ten miles or more
ahead, but so gigantic as to seem bending directly
above him and tottering to crush him and the
world at his feet&mdash;one of the peaks that the innkeeper
had indicated. It was a mountain piled
upon the mountains, a sheer mountain of naked
chalcedonous rock, rising to a snow-topped pinnacle;
and, at its foot, almost at the extreme edge
of the timber-line, a broad, muricated natural gallery,
stood a vast Gothic pile, a somber, rambling
mass of wall and tower: the castle of the Eskurolas.</p>

<p>Almost as Cartaret looked, the sun went down
behind that peak and wrapped the way in utter
darkness. The traveler regarded with something
like dismay the last faint glow that vanished from
the west.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So sorry you had to go,&rdquo; he said, addressing
the departed lord of day. He tried to look about
him. &ldquo;A nice fix I&rsquo;m in,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>He attempted to ride on in the dark, but, remembering
the precipices, dared not touch rein.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>245]</a></span>
He thought of trusting to the instinct of the mare,
but that soon failed him: the animal came to a
full stop. The stillness grew profound, the night
impenetrable.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, there was a wild cacophony
from the forest on his left. It shook the air and
set the echoes clanging from cliff to cavern. The
mare reared and snorted. Lights danced among
the trees; the lights became leaping flames; the
noise was identifiable as the clatter of dogs and
the shouts of men. Cartaret subdued his mare
just as a torch-bearing party of picturesquely-garbed
hunters plunged into the road directly in
front of him and came, at sight of him, to a stand.</p>

<p>In the flickering light from a trio of burning
pine-knots, the sight was enough strange. There
were six men in all: three of them, in peasant costume,
bearing aloft the torches, and two more,
similarly dressed, holding leashes at which huge
boar-hounds tugged. A pair of torch-bearers carried
a large bough from the shoulder of one to
the shoulder of the other, and suspended feet upward
from this bough&mdash;bending with the weight&mdash;was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>246]</a></span>
a great, gray-black boar, its woolly hair red
with blood, the coarse bristles standing erect like
a comb along its spine, its two enormous tusks
prism-shaped and shining like prisms in the light
from the pine-knots.</p>

<p>A deep bass voice issued a challenge in <i lang="eu" xml:lang="eu">Eskura</i>.
It came from the sixth member of the party, unmistakably
in command.</p>

<p>He was one of the biggest men Cartaret had
ever seen. He must have stood six-feet-six in his
boots and was proportionately broad, deep-chested
and long-armed. In one hand he held an old-fashioned
boar-spear&mdash;its blade was red&mdash;as a
sportsman that scorns the safety of a boar-hunt
with a modern rifle.</p>

<p>The torchlight, flickering over his tanned and
bearded face, showed features handsome and aquiline,
fashioned with a severe nobility. Instead of
a hat, a scarf of red silk was wrapped about his
black curls and knotted at one side. His eyes,
under eagle-brows, were fierce and gray. Cartaret
instinctively recalled his early ideas of a dark
Wotan in the <i>Nibelungen-Lied</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>247]</a></span>
The American dismounted. He said, in English:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are the Don Ricardo Ethenard-Eskurola?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had guessed rightly: the big man bowed
assent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an American,&rdquo; explained Cartaret. &ldquo;The
innkeeper down in the valley told me your castle
was near here, so I thought that this was you. I&rsquo;m
rather caught here by the darkness. I wonder
if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He noted Eskurola&rsquo;s eye and did not
like it. &ldquo;I wonder if there&rsquo;s another inn&mdash;one
somewhere near here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Basque frowned. For a moment he said
nothing. When he did speak it was in the slow,
but precise, English that Cartaret had first heard
from the lips of the Lady of the Rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, sir, are upon my land&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry,&rdquo; said Cartaret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; continued Don Ricardo, &ldquo;I could not
permit to go to a mere inn any gentleman whom
darkness has overtaken upon the land of the Eskurolas.
It is true: on my land merely, you are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>248]</a></span>
not my guest; according to our customs, I am permitted
to fight a duel, if need arises, with a gentleman
that is on my land.&rdquo; He smiled: he had, in
the torchlight, a fearsome smile. &ldquo;But on my
land, you are in the way of becoming my guest.
Will you be so good as to accompany me to my
poor house and accept such entertainment as my
best can give you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret accepted, and, in the act, thought the
acceptance too ready.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray remount,&rdquo; urged Eskurola.</p>

<p>But Cartaret said that he would walk with his
host, and so the still trembling mare was given to
an unencumbered torch-bearer to lead, and, by
the light of the pine-knots, the party began its
ten-mile climb.</p>

<p>The night air, at that altitude, was keen even
in Summer, and the way was dark. The American
had an uneasy sense that he was often toiling
along the edges of invisible abysses, and once or
twice, from the forest, he heard the scurry of a
fox and saw the green eyes of a lynx. He tried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>249]</a></span>
to make conversation and, to his surprise, found
himself courteously met more than half way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know very little of this part of Spain,&rdquo; he
said: &ldquo;nothing, in fact, except what I&rsquo;ve learned
in the past few days and what the innkeeper
down there told me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We Basques do not call this a part of Spain,&rdquo;
Eskurola corrected him in a voice patently striving
to be gentle; &ldquo;and the innkeeper knows little.
He is but a poor thing from Navarre.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Cartaret agreed; &ldquo;the staple of his talk
was the statement that he knew nothing at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eskurola smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the truth,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>He went on to speak freely enough of his own
people. He explained something of their almost
Mongolian language: its genderless nouns; its
countless diminutives; its endless compounds
formed by mere juxtaposition and elision; its
staggering array of affixes to supply all ordinary
grammatical distinctions, doing away with our
need of periphrasis and making the ending of a
word determine its number and person and mood,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>250]</a></span>
the case and number of the object, and even the
rank, sex and number of the persons addressed.</p>

<p>He talked with a modesty so formed as really
to show his high pride in everything that was
Basque. When Cartaret pressed him, he told,
with only a pretense of doubt in his voice, how
the Celtiberi considered themselves descendants
of the ocean-engulfed Atalantes, and former owners
of all the Spanish peninsula. Even now, he
insisted, they were the sole power over themselves
from the bold coast-line of Vizcaya to the borders
of Navarre and had so been long before Sancho
the Wise was forced to grant them a <i lang="eu" xml:lang="eu">fuero</i>. They
had always named their own governors and fixed
their own taxes by republican methods. The sign
of the Vascongadas, the three interlaced hands
with the motto <i>Iruracacabat</i>, signified three-in-one,
because delegates from their three parliaments
met each year to care for the common interests
of all; but there was no written pact between
them: the Basques were people of honor.</p>

<p>Spain? Don Ricardo disliked its mention. St.
Mary of Salvaterra! The Basque parliaments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>251]</a></span>
named a deputation that negotiated with representatives
of the Escorial and preserved Basque
liberties and law. If Madrid called that sovereignty,
it was welcome to the term.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We remain untouched by Spain,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and untouched by the world. Our legends are
still Grecian, our customs are what the English
call &lsquo;iron-clad.&rsquo; Basque blood is Basque and so
remains. It never mixes. It could mix in only
one contingency.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret was glad that the darkness hid his
flushed cheek as he answered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have recently heard of that contingency.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It never occurs,&rdquo; said Eskurola quickly, &ldquo;because
the Basque always chooses not to permit
himself to be saved. It is a traditional law among
us as strong as that against the disgrace of suicide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their feet were sounding over a bridge: the
bridge, as Cartaret reflected, to the castle&rsquo;s moat.
Through the light of the torches, the great gray
walls of the pile climbed above him and disappeared
into the night. A studded door, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>252]</a></span>
mighty heaving of bolts, swung open before them,
and they passed through into a vaulted gateway.
The pine-knots cast dancing shadows on the
stones.</p>

<p>Into what medieval world was he being admitted?
Did Vitoria indeed inhabit it? And if
she did, what difficulties and dangers must he
overcome before ever he could take her thence?</p>

<p>Don Ricardo was speaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I welcome you to my poor home,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Cartaret&rsquo;s heart beat high. He was ready for
any difficulty, for any danger....</p>

<p>With a solemn boom the great gate swung shut
behind him. He felt that it had shut out the
Twentieth Century.</p>

<p>Cartaret was lighted by his host himself to a
bedroom high up in the castle and deep within it&mdash;a
bedroom big enough and dreary enough to
hold all the ghosts of Spain. An old man-servant
brought him a supper calculated to stay the hunger
of a shipwrecked merchant-crew. He lay down in
a great four-poster bed both canopied and curtained,
and, in spite of his weariness, he tossed
for hours, wondering whether Vitoria was also
somewhere within those grim walls and what
course he was to pursue in regard to her.</p>

<p>The same uncertainty gripped him when breakfast
was brought to his bedside in the early morning.
Was this, after all, Vitoria&rsquo;s home; and if it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>254]</a></span>
was, had she returned to it? Supposing an affirmative
answer to these questions, what was he
to say to her brother? So far, thank Heaven,
Don Ricardo, though he had once or twice looked
queerly at the American, had been too polite to
make awkward inquiries, but such inquiries were
so natural that they were bound soon to be made;
and Cartaret could not remain forever an unexplained
and self-invited guest in the castle of his
almost involuntary host. The guest recalled all
that he had heard of the national and family pride
and traditions of the Eskurolas, and only his native
hopefulness sustained him.</p>

<p>He found his own way down twisting stairs
and into a vast court-yard across which servants
were passing. The great gate was open, and he
stepped through it toward the battlemented terrace
that he saw beyond.</p>

<p>His first shock was there. The bridge that he
had crossed the night before was indeed a drawbridge
and did indeed span the castle-moat, but
the bridge was unrailed and that moat was a terrible
thing. It was no pit of twenty or thirty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>255]</a></span>
feet dug by the hand of man. The terrace to
which the castle clung was separated from that
to which climbed the steep approach by a natural
chasm of at least twelve yards across, with sheer
sides, like those of a glacial crevasse, shooting
downwards into black invisibility and echoing
upward the thunderous rush of unseen waters.</p>

<p>Leaning on the weather-worn wall that climbed
along the edge of this precipice and guarded a
broad promenade between it and the castle, Cartaret
looked with a new sensation at the marvelous
scene about him. Behind rose the frowning
castle, a maze of parapets and towers, built
against that naked, snow-capped, chalcedonous
peak. In front, falling away through a hundred
gradations of green, a riot of luxuriant vegetation,
lay the now apparently uninhabited country
through which he had ridden, and beyond this,
circling it like the teeth of the celestial dragon
that the Chinese believe is to swallow the sun,
rose row on row of bare mountains, ridges and
pinnacles blue and gray.</p>

<p>A hand fell on Cartaret&rsquo;s shoulder. He turned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>256]</a></span>
to find Don Ricardo standing beside him. The
giant gave every appearance of having been up
and about for hours, and, despite his bulk, he had
approached his guest unheard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I trust that you, sir, have slept well in my
poor house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret replied that he had slept like a top.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that you could eat of the little breakfast
which my servants provided?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I made a wonderful breakfast,&rdquo; said Cartaret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is good, sir. If you can bear with my house,
it is yours for so long as you care to honor it with
your presence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret knew that this must be only an exaggerated
fashion of speech, but he chose to take it
literally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very good of you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
ridden for years and I&rsquo;m rather done up. If you
really don&rsquo;t mind, I think I will rest here over
another night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Don Ricardo seemed unprepared for this, but
he checked a frown and bowed gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A year would be too short for me,&rdquo; he vowed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>257]</a></span>
They fell to talking, the host now trying to
turn the conversation into the valley, the guest
holding it fast to the castle-heights.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a beautiful place,&rdquo; said Cartaret; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know when I&rsquo;ve seen anything to compare with
it; and yet I should think you&rsquo;d find it rather
lonely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not lonely, sir,&rdquo; said the Basque. &ldquo;The hunting
in the valley is a compensation. For example,
where you see those oaks about the curve of
that river, I hunted, not ten days ago, a wolf as
large as those for which my ancestors paid the
wolf-money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; Cartaret persisted, &ldquo;you do live here
quite alone, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He knew that he was impudent, and he felt
that only his host&rsquo;s reverence for the laws of hospitality
prevented an open resentment. Nevertheless,
Cartaret was bound to find out what he
could, and this time he was rewarded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is good enough to live with me,&rdquo; said
Don Ricardo stiffly, &ldquo;my lady sister, the Do&ntilde;a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>258]</a></span>
Dolorez Eulalia Vitoria.&rdquo; He looked out across
the chasm.</p>

<p>Cartaret caught his breath. There was an awkward
pause. Then, glancing up, he saw, coming
toward them along the terrace, the figure of a
woman-servant that seemed startlingly familiar.</p>

<p>It was Chitta. She was bent, no doubt, on
some household errand to her master, whose face
was luckily turned away&mdash;luckily because, when
she caught sight of Cartaret, her jaw dropped and
her knees gave under her.</p>

<p>Cartaret had just time to knit his brows with
the most forbidding scowl he could assume. The
old woman clasped her hands in what was plainly
a prayer to him to be silent concerning all knowledge
of her and her mistress. A moment more,
and Don Ricardo was giving her orders in the
Basque tongue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our servants,&rdquo; he said apologetically when
she had gone, &ldquo;are faithful, but stupid.&rdquo; His gray
eyes peered at Cartaret searchingly. &ldquo;Very stupid,
sir,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;For instance, you, sir, know
something of our customs; you know that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>259]</a></span>
centuries-old tradition&mdash;the best of laws&mdash;makes it
the worst of social crimes for a Basque to marry
any save a Basque&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped short, holding Cartaret with his
eyes. Cartaret nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; Ricardo continued: &ldquo;one
time a lady of our house&mdash;it was years upon years
ago, when Wellington and the English were here&mdash;fell
in love, or thought that she did, with a
British officer. For an Englishman, his degree
was high, but had he been the English King it
would have served him nothing among us. Knowing
of course that the head of our house would
never consent to such a marriage, this lady commanded
her most loyal servant to assist in an
elopement. Now, the Basque servant must obey
her mistress, but also the Basque servant must
protect the honor of the house that she has the
privilege to serve. This one sought to do both
things. She assisted in the elopement and brought
the lady to the English camp. Then, thus having
been faithful to one duty, she was faithful to the
other: before the wedding, she killed both her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>260]</a></span>
mistress and herself.&rdquo; He turned quickly. &ldquo;Sir,
I have pressing duties in the valley, and you are
too weary to ride with me: my poor house is at
your disposal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret leaned against the parapet and, when
his host was out of earshot, whistled softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a delightful <i>raconteur</i>,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;I
wonder if he meant me to draw any special moral
from that bit of family-history.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He waited until, a quarter of an hour later, he
saw Don Ricardo and two servants ride across the
drawbridge and wind their way toward the valley.
He waited until the green forest engulfed
them. What he was going to do might be questionable
conduct in a guest, but there was no time
to waste over nice points of etiquette. He was
going to find Vitoria.</p>

<p>He started for the court-yard. His plan was
to accost the first servant that he encountered and
mention Chitta&rsquo;s name, but this trouble was saved
him. In the shadowy gateway, he found Chitta
crouching.</p>

<p>She glanced to right and left, saw that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>261]</a></span>
were unobserved, passed beyond a narrow door
that opened into the gate, and led Cartaret up a
spiral stone staircase to the entrance of a circular
room in one of the twin gate-towers. There she
turned and left him alone with Vitoria.</p>

<p>In the center of that bare room, standing beside
one of the bowmen&rsquo;s windows that commanded
the approach to the castle, the Lady of the Rose
awaited him. For an instant, he scarcely recognized
her. She was gowned in a single-piece
Basque dress of embroidered silk, closely fitted
about her full lithe figure to below the hips, the
skirt widening and hanging loosely about her slim
ankles. A black silk scarf, in sharp contrast to
the embroidery, was sewn to the dress and drawn
tightly over the right shoulder, across the bust,
and then draped beneath the left hip. But the
glory of her blue-black hair was as he had first
seen it in the twilight of his far-off studio; the
creamy whiteness of her cheeks was just touched
with pink, and her blue eyes, under curling lashes,
seemed at first the frank eyes that he loved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vitoria!&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>262]</a></span>
She drew back. She raised one hand, its pink
palm toward him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should not have done this,&rdquo; she said in a
rapid whisper. &ldquo;How did you find me? How
did you come here?&rdquo; Her voice was kind, but
steady.</p>

<p>Cartaret stood still. This he had not looked
for. His cheeks were flushed, and the lines about
his mouth deepened, as they always did at moments
of crisis, and made his face very firm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does it matter how?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Not all
the width of the world could have kept me away.
There&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve got to know and know instantly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you should not have come, and you must
go immediately! Listen&mdash;no, listen to me now!
I am not Vitoria Urola in these mountains;
whether I want it or not, I have to be the Do&ntilde;a
Dolorez Ethenard-Eskurola. That would perhaps
sound amusing in the rue du Val de Gr&acirc;ce;
here it is a serious matter: the most serious matter
in this little mountain-world. You will have
to listen to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>263]</a></span>
Cartaret folded his arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Last Winter,&rdquo; she continued, her face challenging
his, &ldquo;I had a time of rebellion against all
these things amongst which I had been brought
up. I had never been farther away from this place
than Alegria, but I had had French and English
governesses, and I read books and dreamed dreams.
I loved to paint; I thought that I could learn
to be a real artist, but I knew that my brother
would think that a shame in an Eskurola and
would never permit his unmarried sister to go to
a foreign city to study. Nevertheless, I was hungry
for the great world outside&mdash;for the real
world&mdash;and so I took poor Chitta, gathered what
jewels were my own and not family-jewels, and
ran away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked from the window to the road that
led into the valley; but the road was still deserted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chitta sold the jewels,&rdquo; she presently went on.
&ldquo;They brought very little; but to me, who had
never used money, it seemed much. We went to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>264]</a></span>
Paris: I and Chitta, who, because she had often
been so far as Vitoria before, became as much my
guardian as she was my servant&mdash;and I was long
afraid to go but a little distance in the streets
without her: the streets terrified me, and, after
one fright, she made me promise to go nowhere
without her. So we took the room that you know
of. We were used to regarding my brother as
all-powerful; we feared that he would find us.
Therefore, we would let no one know who we were
or whence we came. Now that is over.&rdquo; Her
voice trembled a little. She made a hopeless
gesture. &ldquo;It is all over, and we have come back
to our own people.&rdquo; She raised her head proudly;
she had regained her self-control: to Cartaret, she
seemed to have regained an ancient pride. &ldquo;I
have learned that I must be what I was born to
be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He squared his jaw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A slave to your brother&rsquo;s will,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A creature,&rdquo; she answered with steady gaze&mdash;&ldquo;a
creature of the will of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this is nonsense!&rdquo; He came forward.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>265]</a></span>
&ldquo;This sort of thing may have been all very well
in the Fourteenth Century; but we&rsquo;re living in the
Twentieth, and it doesn&rsquo;t go now. Oh,&rdquo;&mdash;he
flung out a hand&mdash;&ldquo;I know all about your old
laws and traditions! I dare say they&rsquo;re extremely
quaint and all that, and I dare say there was a
time when they had some reason in them; but that
time isn&rsquo;t this time, and I refuse to hear any more
about them. I won&rsquo;t let them interfere with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She flashed crimson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You speak for yourself, sir: permit me to
speak for myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His answer was to seize her hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; she ordered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never let you go,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me go. You are a brave man to restrain
a woman! Shall I call a servant?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She struggled fiercely, panting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to make you understand me,&rdquo; he protested,
holding fast her hands. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean
any harm to your traditions or your customs.
Whatever you love I&rsquo;ll try to love too&mdash;just so
long as it doesn&rsquo;t hurt you. But <em>this</em> does hurt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>266]</a></span>
you. Tell me one thing: Why did you leave
Paris? What was it made you change your
mind?&rdquo; He saw in her face the signs of an effort
to disregard the demand. &ldquo;Tell me why you
left Paris,&rdquo; he repeated.</p>

<p>Her eyes wavered. The lids fluttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That night,&rdquo; she began in an uneven tone, &ldquo;I
gave you to understand, that night&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You gave me to understand that you loved
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said it fearlessly, and, on the edge of a sob,
she fearlessly answered him. She had ceased to
struggle. Her hands lay still and cold in his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you that love had brought me a sword.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve changed. What has changed you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not changed. I have only come back
to these unchangeable mountains, to this unchanging
castle, to the ancient laws and customs of my
people&mdash;their ancient and unalterable laws. I
had to come back to them,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;because I
realized that it was not in me to be false to all
that my fathers have for centuries been true to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret leaned forward. He could not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>267]</a></span>
believe that this was her only reason; he could not
understand that the sway of any custom can be
so powerful. He held her hands tighter. His
eyes searched her quailing eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you love me? That&rsquo;s all I want to know,
and I&rsquo;ll attend to everything else. I&rsquo;ve no time
for sparring. I&rsquo;ve got to know if you love me.
I&rsquo;ve got to know that, right here and now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you love me?&rdquo; he relentlessly persisted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To love in Paris is one thing: here I may not
love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may not&mdash;but <em>do</em> you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t. Please don&rsquo;t. Oh!&rdquo;&mdash;her red lips
parted, her breath came fast&mdash;&ldquo;if love were
all&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It <em>is</em> all!&rdquo; he declared. He slipped both her
cold hands into his right hand and put his freed
arm about her waist. &ldquo;Vitoria,&rdquo; he whispered,
drawing her to him, &ldquo;it <em>is</em> all. It&rsquo;s all that matters,
all that counts. It can mock all custom and
defy all law. I love you, Vitoria.&rdquo; Slowly her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>268]</a></span>
eyes closed; slowly she sank against his arm;
slowly her head drooped backward, and slowly he
bent toward its parted, unresisting lips&mdash;&mdash; &ldquo;And
love&rsquo;s the one thing in the world worth living and
dying for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that word, she came to sudden life. With
one wrench, she had darted from his arms. Instantly
she had recovered self-control.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Go away! There is
danger here. Oh, go away!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The suddenness of her action shattered his delirium.
He read in her words only her reply to
the question that he had put to her.</p>

<p>Impossible as it would have seemed a moment
since, that negative meant a catastrophic denial of
any love for him. He glanced at the old walls
that surrounded them&mdash;at all the expressions of a
remorseless self in which he could have no part.
He felt, with a sudden certainty, that these things
were of her, and she of them&mdash;that what she
meant by her distinction between herself in Paris
and this other self here was the vast difference
between a Byzantine empress breaking plebeian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>269]</a></span>
hearts in the alleys of her capital and that same
woman on her throne, passionless and raised above
the reach of men&rsquo;s desires.</p>

<p>The most modest of young fellows is always a
little vain, and his vanity is always wounded; it
is ever seeking hurts, anxious to suffer: Cartaret
was no exception to human rules. He told his
heart that Vitoria&rsquo;s words meant but one thing:
She had entertained herself with him during an
incognito escapade and, now that the escapade was
finished, wanted no reminders. A Byzantine empress?
This was worse: the empress gave, if only
to take away. What Vitoria must mean was that
even her momentary softening toward him on this
spot was no more than momentary. She was saying
that, having had her amusement by making
him love her, she was now returned to her proper
station, where to love her was to insult her. He had
been her plaything, and now she was tired of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you think my love is
worth so little. If you can&rsquo;t brave one miserable
medieval superstition for it, then I&rsquo;ve got the answer
to what I asked you, and you&rsquo;re right: I&rsquo;d
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>270]</a></span>
better go.&rdquo; He turned to the narrow door at the
head of the spiral stairs. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said, as
if to the stone walls about them, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;m not
worth much sacrifice; but my love has been worth
a sacrifice. Some day you&rsquo;ll understand what
my love might have meant. Some day, when
you&rsquo;re old, you&rsquo;ll look from one of these windows
out over these valleys and mountains and think
of what could have happened&mdash;what there was
once, just this one time, one chance for.&rdquo; He
half faced her. &ldquo;Other men will love you, many
of them. They&rsquo;ll love your happiness and grace
and beauty as well, I dare say, as I do and always
will. But you&rsquo;ll remember one man that
loved your soul; you&rsquo;ll remember me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vitoria was swaying dizzily. Her recaptured
self-command visibly wavered. She leaned
against the rough wall. He leaped toward her,
but she had the strength left to warn him away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;I do not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
She raised her hands to the vaulted roof. By a
tremendous effort she became again mistress of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>271]</a></span>
herself&mdash;and of him. &ldquo;Why will you not understand?
I do not love you. Go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment a cry rang out. It was a cry
from the gateway. It was the cry of Chitta, who
came bounding into the narrow room and hurled
herself at her mistress&rsquo;s feet.</p>

<p>Before any one of the trio could speak, there
was the clatter of a galloping horse on the road,
the thunder of hoofs over the drawbridge above
that frightful chasm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; shrieked Vitoria. &ldquo;Will you never go?
Do you not understand what this means? Do
you not know who is coming here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chitta set up a loud wail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care who&rsquo;s coming here,&rdquo; said Cartaret.
&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s any danger&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vitoria leaped over the prostrate servant and
began pushing Cartaret away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hate you!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Do you hear that?
<em>I hate you!</em> Now will you go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at her, and his face hardened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>272]</a></span>
He turned away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My brother!&rdquo; gasped Vitoria.</p>

<p>Don Ricardo came in at the door of the tower-room.</p>



<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>273]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />
<br />
<span class="vsmlfont">IN WHICH CARTARET TAKES PART IN THE
REVIVAL OF AN ANCIENT CUSTOM</span></h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>La vieille humanit&eacute; porte encore dans ses entrailles
la brutalit&eacute; primitive; un anthropo&iuml;de f&eacute;roce survit en
chacun de nous.&mdash;Opinions &agrave; R&eacute;pandre.</p>
</div>


<p>For a moment none moved. There was Chitta,
groveling on the stone floor of the circular room,
her face hidden in her hands; there was Vitoria,
her arms outstretched, struck rigid in the act of
repulsing Cartaret; and there were the two men&mdash;the
American white, but determined and unafraid;
the Basque with a dull red spreading on his tanned
cheeks&mdash;facing each other as pugilists, entering
the ring, face each other at pause during the fleeting
instant before they begin to circle for an
opening. Cartaret, with the eye that, in times of
high emotion, takes account of even trivial detail,
noted how Don Ricardo, who had been forced to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>274]</a></span>
stoop in order to pass the doorway, gradually
straightened himself with a slow, unconscious
expansion of the muscles such as a tiger might employ.</p>

<p>Vitoria was the first to speak: she lowered her
arms and turned upon her brother a glance of
which the pride proved that her self-possession
was regained. She spoke in English, though
whether for Cartaret&rsquo;s comprehension, for the
servant&rsquo;s mystification, or as an added gibe at
Ricardo, the American was unable to determine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You came unannounced, brother,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I am not accustomed to such entrances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The red deepened over Don Ricardo&rsquo;s high
cheek-bones, but he bit his lip and seemed to bite
down his rage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are not your apartments, Do&ntilde;a Dolorez,&rdquo;
he said, adopting, with visible repugnance,
the language she employed. &ldquo;And I am the head
of your house.&rdquo; He bent his gray eyes on Cartaret.
&ldquo;Be so good as to come with me, sir,&rdquo; he
said. He stood aside from the door. &ldquo;I follow
after my guest.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>275]</a></span>
Cartaret&rsquo;s heart had place only for the last
words that Vitoria had said to him. He would
not look at her again, and he cared little what
might happen to himself, so long as he could draw
this irate brother after him and away from the
endangered women. Vitoria had said that she
hated him: well, he would do what he could to
save her, and then leave Alava forever. He passed
through the door....</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is my guest,&rdquo; he heard Don Ricardo saying.
&ldquo;An Eskurola remembers the laws of hospitality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret went on to the court-yard. There
his host followed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you come to my offices?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>He walked across to the north wing of the castle
and into a large room that looked upon the terrace.
The ceiling was a mass of blackened rafters;
the walls, wainscoted in oak, were hung with
ancient arms and armor, with the antlers of deer
and the stuffed heads of tusked boar, and with
some rags of long-faded tapestry. There was a
yawning fire-place at one end, between high
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>276]</a></span>
bookshelves filled with leather-bound folios, and, near
one of the windows, stood an open Seventeenth
Century desk massed with dusty papers.</p>

<p>Eskurola waved his guest to a stiff-backed chair.
Cartaret, seeing that Don Ricardo intended to
remain standing, merely stood beside it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; began the Basque, &ldquo;you have said that
you are a stranger to our country and its ways.
It is my duty to enlighten you in regard to some
details.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He towered nearly half a foot above Cartaret.
The nostrils of his beaked nose quivered above
his bristling beard, but he kept his voice rigorously
to the conversational pitch.</p>

<p>Cartaret, however, was in no mood to hear any
more exposition of Vascongada manners and customs.
He had had enough of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need of that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;ve
done anything I shouldn&rsquo;t have done, I&rsquo;m sorry.
But I want you to understand that I&rsquo;m to blame:
<em>I&rsquo;m</em> to blame&mdash;and nobody else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eskurola went on as if Cartaret had not spoken:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not our custom to present to our ladies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>277]</a></span>
such casual strangers as happen to ask shelter of
us; nor is it the custom of our ladies to permit
such presentations, still less to seek them. Of
that last fact, I say but one word more: the Do&ntilde;a
Dolorez has been lately from home, and I fear
that her contact with the outer world has temporarily
dulled the edge of her native sensitiveness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Cartaret, his hands clenched,
&ldquo;if you mean to imply&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; The Basque&rsquo;s eyes snapped. &ldquo;I speak
of my sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right then. But you&rsquo;d better be told a
few facts, too. Paris isn&rsquo;t Alava. I met the
Do&ntilde;a Dolorez in Paris. We were neighbors.
What could be more natural, then, than that,
when I came here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah-h-h!&rdquo; Eskurola softly interrupted. In
the meshes of his beard, his red lips were smiling
unpleasantly. &ldquo;So that was it! How stupid of
me not to have guessed before, sir. I was sure
that there had been in Paris something beside
Art.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret&rsquo;s impulse was to fly at the man&rsquo;s throat.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>278]</a></span>
His reason, determined to protect the woman that
cared no more for him, dictated another course.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wanted,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;to make your
sister my wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The effect of this statement was twofold. At
first a violent anger shook the Basque, and the
veins stood out in ridges along his neck and at
his temples, below the red cloth bound about his
head. Then, as quickly, the anger passed and was
succeeded by a look reminiscent, almost tender.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know that no alien can marry one of our
people,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You know that now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret thought again of Vitoria&rsquo;s parting
word to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it <em>now</em>,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are my guest,&rdquo; Eskurola pursued. &ldquo;I
shall tell you something. You have seen me only
as what must seem to you a strange and hard
man&mdash;perhaps a fierce and cruel man. I am the
head of my ancient house; on me there depends
not only its honor, but also its continuance. Sir,
I exact of my relatives no less than I have already
exacted of myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>279]</a></span>
Cartaret looked at him in amazement. Could
it be possible that there had ever been in this
medieval mind anything but ruthless pride of race?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Years ago&mdash;but not so many years ago as you,
sir, might suppose&mdash;there came to this house a
young lady. She came here as a governess for my
sister, but she was a lady, a person of birth. Also,
she spoke your language.&rdquo; He paused, and then
went on in a still gentler voice. &ldquo;Sir, because of
her, your language, barbarous as it is, has always
been dear to me, and yet, still because of her, I
have ever since wanted not to speak it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret looked at the floor. Even though this
confession of a past weakness was voluntary, it
seemed somehow unfair to watch, during it, the
man whose pride was so strong.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you sent her away?&rdquo; he found himself
asking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She went when her work was finished. She
went without knowing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret raised his eyes. There was no false
assumption in the man upon whom they rested: it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>280]</a></span>
was impossible to believe that, seeing him thus, a
woman would not love him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; said Cartaret. Eskurola&rsquo;s words had
assured him of Vitoria&rsquo;s safety. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would not drive you away. You have said
that you would be my guest for another night; you
may remain as long as you care to remain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; Cartaret repeated. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t you
that&rsquo;s driving me. Will you please send up to my
room for my saddle-bags, and have my mare
brought around?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Don Ricardo bowed. He went out.</p>

<p>Cartaret stood for some time on the spot where
he had been standing throughout the talk with
his host. He was thinking of his ruined hopes and
of the woman that had ruined them. Once he
asked himself what had so changed her; but, when
he could find no answer to that question, he asked
what the cause could matter, since the effect was
so apparent. He walked to a window. He could
see that part of the terrace which lay between the
gate and the drawbridge, but he saw no sign of
his mare. What could Eskurola be doing? He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>281]</a></span>
seemed, whatever it was, to be a long time about
it.</p>

<p>The oaken door of the room opened and closed
with a bang. Don Ricardo stood before it. The
dull red had returned to his cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have just been having another
word with the Do&ntilde;a Dolorez: she informs me that
you have had the impertinence to tell her that you
love her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret laughed bitterly. &ldquo;In <em>my</em> country,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;when a man wants to marry a woman it
is customary to say something of that kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are in Alava, sir, and you speak of a member
of my family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was in Paris then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this morning&mdash;just now?&rdquo; Eskurola
came a step forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t talk any more about it,&rdquo; said Cartaret.
&ldquo;Please have my mare brought around at
once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Eskurola replied: &ldquo;you shall talk no
more about it. Mr. Cartaret, you must fight me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The American could not believe his ears. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>282]</a></span>
recollected that when the Continental speaks of
fighting he does not refer to mere pugilism.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re crazy,&rdquo; said Cartaret. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want
to fight you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So soon as you have passed that gate, you will
be my guest no longer. What, sir, you may then
want will not matter. You will have to fight me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret sat down. He crossed his legs and
looked up at his host.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this your little way of persuading me to
stay awhile?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot go too soon to please me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then perhaps you&rsquo;ll be good enough to tell
me what it&rsquo;s all about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eskurola&rsquo;s giant figure bent forward. His eyes
blazed down in Cartaret&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You came into this place, the place of my people,
under false pretenses. I made you welcome;
you were my guest, sir. Yet you used your opportunities
to insult my sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret got slowly to his feet. He knew the
probable consequences of what he was about to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>283]</a></span>
say, but, never shifting his gaze from the Basque&rsquo;s,
he said it quietly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Don Ricardo leaped backward. It was doubtless
the first time in his life that such a phrase
had been addressed to him, and he received it as
he might have received a blow. Both in mind
and body, he staggered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My sister has told me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear any more, se&ntilde;or. I&rsquo;ve
said all that I have to say.&rdquo; Cartaret thrust his
hands into the pockets of his riding-breeches and,
turning his back on Eskurola, looked out of the
window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; the Basque was saying, as his mental
balance reasserted itself&mdash;&ldquo;now we must indeed
fight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret himself was thinking rapidly and by
no means clearly. To say that dueling was not
an American custom would avail him nothing&mdash;would
be interpreted as cowardice; to fight with
a man bred as Don Ricardo was evidently bred
would be to walk out to death. Cartaret
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>284]</a></span>
looked at the panorama of the mountains. Well,
why not death? Less than an hour ago his
whole life had been mined, had been sent crashing
about his head. The only thing that he
cared for in life was taken from him: Vitoria
had herself declared that she hated him. Nor
that alone&mdash;the thought burned in his brain: she
had told this wild brother of hers that he, Cartaret,
had insulted her; she had incited Eskurola
to battle&mdash;perhaps to save herself, perhaps to
salve some strange Basque conception of honor
or pride. So be it; Cartaret could render her one
more service&mdash;the last: if he allowed himself to
be killed by this half-savage who so serenely
thought that he was better than all the rest of the
world, Don Ricardo&rsquo;s wounded honor would be
healed, and Vitoria&mdash;now evidently herself in
danger or revengeful&mdash;would be either safe or
pacified. The Twentieth Century had never entered
these mountains, and Cartaret, entering
them, had left his own modernity behind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;since you&rsquo;re so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>285]</a></span>
confounded hungry for it, I&rsquo;ll fight you. Anything
to oblige.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked about to find Eskurola bowing gratefully:
the man&rsquo;s eyes seemed to be selecting the
spot on their enemy&rsquo;s body at which to inflict the
fatal wound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad, sir, that you see reason,&rdquo; said Don
Ricardo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that I see reason,&rdquo; said Cartaret,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;m going to fight you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not suppose that you can use a rapier,
Mr. Cartaret?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was clear that not to understand the rapier
was to be not quite a gentleman; but Cartaret
made the confession. &ldquo;Not that it matters,&rdquo; he
reflected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you can shoot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret remembered the boyish days when he
had taken prizes for his marksmanship with a revolver.
It was the one folly of his youth that he
had continued, and he found a certain satisfaction
(so much did Eskurola&rsquo;s pride impress him)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>286]</a></span>
in admitting this, albeit he did not mean to use
the accomplishment now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I carry this with me,&rdquo; said he, producing his
automatic revolver.</p>

<p>Don Ricardo scarcely glanced at it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is not the weapon for a marksman,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Nevertheless, let me see what you can
do. None will be disturbed; these walls are
sound-proof.&rdquo; He took a gold coin, an alfonso,
from his pocket and flung it into the air. &ldquo;Shoot!&rdquo;
he commanded.</p>

<p>Cartaret had expected nothing of the sort. He
fired and missed. The report roared through the
room; the acrid taste of the powder filled the air.
Eskurola caught the descending coin in his hand.
Cartaret saw that his failure had annoyed Don
Ricardo, and this in its turn annoyed the American.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were going to try me,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m not used to marking up the ceilings
of my friends&rsquo; houses. Try again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Basque, without comment, flung up the
alfonso a second time, and a second time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>287]</a></span>
Cartaret fired. Eskurola reached for the coin as before,
but this time it flew off at an angle and
struck the farther wall. When they picked it up,
they found that it had been hit close to the edge
of the disk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not the center,&rdquo; said Don Ricardo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; said Cartaret. What sort of shot
would please the man? &ldquo;Suppose you try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eskurola explained that he was not accustomed
to such a revolver, but he would not shirk the challenge;
and there was no need for him to shirk it:
when Cartaret recovered the alfonso after Don
Ricardo had shot, there was a mark full in its
middle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So much for His Spanish Majesty,&rdquo; said the
Basque, as he glanced at the mark made by his
bullet in the face upon the coin. &ldquo;We shall use
dueling-pistols. I have them here.&rdquo; He went to
the desk.</p>

<p>Cartaret had no doubt that Eskurola had them
there: he probably had a rack and thumbscrews
handy below-stairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>288]</a></span>
&ldquo;We shall have to dispense with the formality
of a surgeon,&rdquo; Don Ricardo was saying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look as if one would be needed,&rdquo;
Cartaret smiled; &ldquo;and it doesn&rsquo;t look as if we
were to have seconds, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Basque turned sharply. &ldquo;We are the only
gentlemen within miles, and we cannot have servants
for witnesses. Moreover, an Eskurola needs
no seconds, either of his choosing to watch his
safety, or of his enemy&rsquo;s to suspect his honor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He pressed a spring, released a secret drawer
in the desk and found what he was seeking: a
box of polished mahogany. Opening the lid, he
beckoned to Cartaret. There, on a purple velvet
lining, lay a beautifully kept pair of dueling-pistols,
muzzle-loaders of the Eighteenth Century
pattern and of about .32 caliber, their long
octagonal barrels of shining dark blue steel, their
curved butts of ivory handsomely inlaid with a
Moorish design in gold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Eskurola, &ldquo;as we are to have no
seconds, I shall write a line to exculpate you in
case you survive me. Then&rdquo;&mdash;his gray eyes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>289]</a></span>
shone; he seemed to take a satisfaction that was
close to delight in arranging these lethal details&mdash;&ldquo;also
as we are to have no seconds to give a
signal, we shall have but one true shot between us.
Certainly. Are we not men, we two? And we
have proved ourselves marksmen. You cannot
doubt me, but I have a man that speaks French, so
that you shall see that I do not trick you, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went to the door and called into the court-yard.
Presently there answered him a man whom
Cartaret recognized as one of those who, the night
before, held the dogs in leash.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Murillo Gomez,&rdquo; said Eskurola, in a French
more labored than his English, &ldquo;in five minutes
this gentleman and I shall want the terrace to ourselves.
You will close the gate when we go out.
You will remain on this side of it, and you will
permit none to pass. Answer me in French.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The servant&rsquo;s face showed no surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oui, se&ntilde;or</i>,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you will take these pistols and bring them
back without delay. In the armory you will load
one with powder and shot, the other with powder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>290]</a></span>
only. Neither this gentleman nor I must know
which is which. You understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The servant&rsquo;s face was still impassive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oui, se&ntilde;or.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go then. Also see that the Do&ntilde;a Dolorez remains
in her own apartments. And hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The servant disappeared with the pistols.
Eskurola, apologizing gravely, went to the desk
and wrote&mdash;apparently the lines of which he had
spoken. He sanded them, folded the paper, lit a
candle and sealed the missive with an engraved
jade ring that he wore on the little finger of his
left hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is your first duel, sir?&rdquo; he said to Cartaret.
He said it much as an Englishman at
luncheon might ask an American guest whether he
had ever eaten turbot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Cartaret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you may have what the gamblers of
London call &lsquo;beginner&rsquo;s luck.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The servant knocked at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you be so good as to take the pistols?&rdquo;
asked Don Ricardo in English of Cartaret. &ldquo;It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>291]</a></span>
appears better if I do not speak with him. Thank
you. And please to tell him in French that he may
have your mare and saddle-bags ready in the gateway
within five minutes, in case you should want
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret obeyed.</p>

<p>Eskurola again held the door for his guest to
pass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After you, sir,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>They crossed the court-yard leisurely and
shoulder to shoulder, for all the world as if they
were two friends going out to enjoy the view.
Any one observing them from the windows, had
there been any one, would have said that Don Ricardo
was pointing out to Cartaret the beauties
of the scene. In reality he was saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;With your agreement, we shall fix the distance
at ten paces, and I shall step it. There is no choice
for light, and the wind is at rest. Therefore, there
being no person to count for us, I shall ask you
to toss a coin again, this time that I may call it:
if I fail to do so, you fire first; if I succeed, I
fire first. Permit me to advise you, sir, that, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>292]</a></span>
you are unaccustomed to the hair-trigger, it is as
well that you be careful lest you lose your shot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eskurola&rsquo;s manners were apparently never so
polished as when he was about to kill or be killed.
He measured off the ground and marked the stand
for each, always asking Cartaret&rsquo;s opinion. He
stood while Cartaret again tossed a glittering gold-piece
in the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tails!&rdquo; cried Don Ricardo. &ldquo;I always prefer,&rdquo;
he explained, &ldquo;to see this king with his face
in the dust. Let us look at him together, so that
there will be no mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The piece lay with its face to the terrace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I win,&rdquo; said Eskurola. &ldquo;I shoot first. It is
bad to begin well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret smiled. With such a marksman as
this Basque to shoot at one, the speech became the
merest pleasantry. There was only the question
of the choice of the pistol, and as to that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will open the box, I shall choose,&rdquo;
Eskurola was saying. Evidently the choice was
also to go to the winner of the toss. Cartaret
was certain this would not have been the case if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>293]</a></span>
the toss had gone otherwise. &ldquo;I must touch
neither until I have chosen, although the additional
powder in the blank pistol tends toward
making their weight equal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mechanically Cartaret opened the mahogany
box. Don Ricardo scarcely glanced at the pair
of beautiful and deadly weapons lying on the
purple velvet: he took the one farther from him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray remember the hair-trigger,&rdquo; he continued:
&ldquo;you might easily wound yourself. Now, if you
please: to our places.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Each man took off his hat and coat and stood
at his post in his white shirt, his feet together, his
right side fronting his enemy, his pistol pointing
downwards from the hand against his right
thigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you ready, sir?&rdquo; asked Eskurola.</p>

<p>For a flashing instant Cartaret wanted to scream
with hysterical laughter: the whole proceeding
seemed so archaic, so grotesque, so useless. Then
he thought of how little he had to lose and of
whom he might serve in losing that little....</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ready, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>294]</a></span>
If only she could, for only that last moment,
love him! That last moment, for he made no
doubt of the end of this adventure. The Basque
had been too punctilious in all his arrangements:
from the first Cartaret had been sure that Don
Ricardo and the French-speaking servant had
played this tragic farce before, and that the master
so arranged matters as easily to choose the one
pistol that held death in its mouth. To convict
him was impossible, and, were it possible, would
be but to strike a fatal blow at the honor of that
family which Vitoria held so dear. How false his
vanity had played him! What was he that a
goddess should not cease to love him when she
chose? Enough and more that she had loved him
once; an ultimate blessing could she love him a
moment more. But once again, then: but that
one instant! To see her pitiful eyes upon him,
to hear her pure lips whisper the last good-by like
music in his dying ears!</p>

<p>He saw the arm of his enemy slowly&mdash;slowly&mdash;rising,
without speed and without hesitation, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>295]</a></span>
the paw of a great cat rises to strike, but with a
claw of shining steel.</p>

<p>Cartaret would look his last on the scene that
her eyes had known when she was a child, that
her eyes would know long after his&mdash;so soon now!&mdash;were
closed forever. It was mid-morning; the
golden sun was half-way to the zenith. At Cartaret&rsquo;s
left, above the walls, the turrets and towers
of the Gothic castle, rose the sheer front of that
sheer chalcedonous peak. Its top was crowned
with the dazzling and eternal snow; its face was
waxen, almost translucent; its outcroppings of
crypto-crystalline quartz, multi-toned by the wind
and rain of centuries, caught the sunlight and
flamed in every gradation of blue and yellow, of
onyx, carnelian and sard. To the right lay the
wide and peaceful valley, mass after mass of
foliage, silver-green and emerald, and, above that,
the ridges of the vast, scabrous amphitheater:
beetling peaks of gray, dark pectinated cones,
fusiform apexes, dancing lancets and swords&rsquo;
points, a hundred beetling crags and darting spires
under a turquoise sky.</p>

(Eskurola&rsquo;s arm was rising ... rising....)</p>

<p>Her face came before his eyes; not the face of
the woman that sent him from the tower-room,
but the face of The Girl that had parted from him
in his shabby studio: the frame of blue-black
hair, the clear cheek touched with healthy pink,
the red lips and white teeth, the level brows, the
curling lashes and the frank violet eyes....
Into his own eyes came a mist; it blotted out the
landscape.</p>

<p>He dragged his glance back to his executioner.
He must meet death face forward. A horrid fear
beset him that he had been tardy in this&mdash;had
seemed ever so little to waver.</p>

<p>But Eskurola had observed no faltering, and
had not faltered: his arm still crept upward. It
must all have happened in the twinkling of an
eye, then: that impulse toward mad laughter, that
thought of what he had suffered, that realization
of the landscape, even the memory of her face&mdash;the
Lady of the Rose.</p>

<p>Don Ricardo&rsquo;s arm had just risen a trifle above
his shoulder and then come back to its level....
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>297]</a></span>
It would come now&mdash;the flash, the quick pang that
would outstrip and shut out the very sound of
the explosion&mdash;come now and be over.</p>

<p>The man was taking an aim, careful,
deadly....</p>

<p>But if everything else had been quick, this was
an eternity. Cartaret could feel the Basque&rsquo;s
eye, he could see that the leveled pistol-barrel
covered his throat directly below the ear. He
wanted to shout out to Eskurola to shoot; to say,
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got me!&rdquo; He ground his teeth to enforce
his tongue to silence. And still he waited. Good
God, would the man never fire?</p>

<p>Don Ricardo was lowering his pistol, and his
pistol was smoking. He had fired. Moreover, he
had aimed truly. But he had chosen his weapon
honorably&mdash;it was the one that did not hold a
bullet.</p>

<p>Cartaret was dazed, but knew instantly what
to do. As if it was the performance of an act
long since subconsciously decided upon, he raised
his own pistol slowly&mdash;the death-laden pistol&mdash;and
shot straight up into the air....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>298]</a></span>
The smoke was still circling about the American&rsquo;s
head when he saw Eskurola striding toward
him. The Basque&rsquo;s face was a study of humiliation
and dismay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;After I have
tried to kill you, you do not kill me? You refuse
to kill me? You inflict the greatest insult and
the only one that I cannot resent?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret threw down his pistol: it frightened
him now. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s an insult to
let you live or not,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t care a
damn. Where&rsquo;s my mare?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went to the gate. It was opened by the
French-speaking servant, wide-eyed now, but with
his curiosity inarticulate. Cartaret mounted. His
hand trembled as he gathered up the reins. He
was angry at this and at the comedy that Fate had
made of his attempted heroism. Was there ever
before, he reflected, a duel the two principals of
which were angry because they survived?</p>

<p>Eskurola was standing at the edge of the unrailed
drawbridge that crossed the precipitous
abyss. It was evident even to Cartaret that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>299]</a></span>
Basque was still too amazed to think, much less
speak, coherently; that something beyond his comprehension
had occurred; that a phenomenon
hitherto unknown had wrecked his cosmos.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;will you not return first into
the castle and there&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t get out of my way,&rdquo; said Cartaret,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ride you into this chasm!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Don Ricardo drew dumbly aside, and Cartaret
rode on. With Vitoria relentless and unattainable,
abjured by the woman he had loved, robbed
even of the chance to give his life for her, he was
riding anywhere to get away from Alava, was
fleeing from his sense of loss and failure. He rode
as fast as the steep descent permitted, and only
once, at a sharp twist of the way, a full mile down
the mountain, did he allow himself to turn in his
saddle and look back.</p>

<p>There was Eskurola, a silhouette against the
gray walls. Behind him rose the castle of his
fathers, and back of it the great peak towered,
through a hundred flashing colors, to its shining
crown of eternal snow.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<br />
<span class="vsmlfont">AND LAST</span></h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>It must be a very dear and intimate reality for which
people will be content to give up a dream.&mdash;Hawthorne:
<i>The Marble Faun</i>.</p>
</div>


<p>Summer held Paris in his arms when Cartaret
returned there&mdash;held her, wearied from the dance
with Spring, in his warm arms, and was rocking
her to sleep. Romance had crowded commerce
from the boulevards; poets wrote their verses at
the marble-topped tables along the awninged pavements;
the lesser streets were lovers&rsquo; lanes.</p>

<p>For Cartaret had not hurried. Once the Pyrenees
were behind him, he felt growing upon him
a dread of any return to the city in which he had
first met and loved the Lady of the Rose; and only
the necessity of settling his affairs there&mdash;of collecting
his few possessions, paying two or three
remaining bills and bidding a last good-by to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>301]</a></span>
friends&mdash;drew him forward. He lingered at one
town after the other, caring nothing for what he
saw, but hating the thought of even a week in a
Paris without her. Vaguely he had decided to return
to America, though what of interest life could
hold there, or anywhere, for him he could not
imagine: some dull business routine, most likely&mdash;for
he would never paint again&mdash;and the duller
the better. Thus he wasted a fortnight along the
Loire and among the chateaux of Touraine and
found himself at last leaving his train in the
Gare D&rsquo;Orsay at the end of a Summer afternoon.</p>

<p>He made for his own room with the objectless
hurry of a native American, his feet keeping time
to a remembered stanza of Andrew Lang:</p>

<div class="cpoem3">

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Taciturn Refrogn&eacute; seemed no more surprised
to see him than if he had gone out but an hour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>302]</a></span>
since: the trade of the Parisian concierge slays
surprise early.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A letter for monsieur,&rdquo; said Refrogn&eacute;.</p>

<p>Cartaret took it from the grimy paw that was
extended out of the concierge&rsquo;s cave. He went
on up the stairs.</p>

<p>The door of the magic Room Opposite&mdash;in all
probability commonplace enough now&mdash;stood
slightly ajar, and Cartaret felt a new pang as he
glanced at it. He passed on to his own room.</p>

<p>His own room! It was precisely as he had seen
it last&mdash;a little dustier, and far more dreary, but
with no other change. The table at which she had
leaned, the easel on which he had painted those
portraits of her, were just as when he had left
them. He went to the window at which he used
to store the provisions that Chitta looted, and
there he opened the envelope Refrogn&eacute; had given
him. It contained only one piece of paper: A
Spanish draft on the Comptoir G&eacute;n&eacute;ral for a hundred
and twenty francs, and on the back, in a
labored English script, was written:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>303]</a></span>
&ldquo;For repayment of the sum advanced to my servant,
Chitta Grekekora.</p>

<p class="sigleft">&ldquo;Ricardo B.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;R. Ethenard-Eskurola (d&rsquo;Alegria).&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>A limb of wisteria had climbed to the window
and hung a cluster of its purple flowers on the
sill. Below, Refrogn&eacute;&rsquo;s lilacs were in full bloom,
and the laughter of Refrogn&eacute;&rsquo;s children rose from
among them as piercing sweet as the scent of the
flowers. Cartaret took a match from his pocket,
struck it and set the bit of paper aflame. He
held it until the flame burnt his fingers, crushed it
in his palm and watched the ashes circle slowly
downward toward the lilac-trees.</p>

<p>The sun had set and, as Cartaret walked aimlessly
toward the front windows, the long shadows
of the twilight were deepening from wall to wall.
Summer was in all the air.</p>

<p>So much the same! He leaned forward and
looked down into the silent rue du Val-de-Gr&acirc;ce.
He was thinking how she had once stood where
he was leaning now; thinking how he had leaned
there so often, looking for her return up that narrow
thoroughfare, waiting for the sound of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>304]</a></span>
light footfall on the stair. So much the same, indeed:
the unchanged street outside, the unchanged
room within; the room in which he had found her
on that February night. Here she had admitted
that she loved him, and here she had said the
good-by that he would not understand&mdash;a few
short weeks ago. And now he was back&mdash;back
after having heard her repudiate him, back after
losing her forever.</p>

<p>Fate works everywhere, but her favorite workshop
is Paris. Something was moving in the
deepest shadow in the room&mdash;the shadow about
the doorway. Blue-black hair and long-lashed
eyes of violet, lips of red and cheeks of white
and pink; the incredible was realized, the miracle
had happened: Vitoria was here.</p>

<p>He was beside her in a single bound. He
thought that he cried her name aloud; in reality,
his lips moved without speech.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; she said. She drew away from him;
but the statues of the Greek gods in the Luxembourg
gardens must have felt the thrill in the
evening air as she faced him. She was looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>305]</a></span>
at him bravely with only the least tremor of her
lips. &ldquo;Do you&mdash;do you still love me?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>Her voice was like a violin; her words dazed
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Love you? I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t tell you how much&mdash;I&mdash;haven&rsquo;t
the words to say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He seized the hand with which she had checked
him and kissed its unjeweled fingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?... Why did you say you hated
me?... What has brought you back?... Is
is true? Is it <em>true</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>From Refrogn&eacute;&rsquo;s garden came the last good-night-song
of the birds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Love you? Why, from the day I left you&mdash;no,
from that night I found you here, I&rsquo;ve
thought nothing but Vitoria, dreamed nothing
but Vitoria&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now incoherent and afraid, then with hectic
eloquence and finally with a complete abandon, he
poured out his soul in libation to her. With the
first word of it, she saw that she was forgiven.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to&mdash;to tell you this: You
know now that I ran away from Paris because I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>306]</a></span>
loved you and knew that I could not marry you;
but you do not know why I said that terrible thing
which I said in the tower-room. I was afraid of
what my brother might do to you. That is why I
would not take your kisses. To try to make you
leave before he found you, I said what first came
to my mind as likely to drive you away. I said
it at what fearful cost! I blasphemed against
my love for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret was recovering himself. Love gives
all, but it demands everything.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your brother said that I had offered you some
insult. He said you&rsquo;d told him so. I thought
you&rsquo;d told him that in order to make him all the
angrier against me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ever since Chitta and I returned to our home,
he had been suspecting,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He would
not forgive me for going away. Chitta he tortured,
but she told him nothing. Me, he kept
almost a prisoner. When you came, I knew that
he would soon guess what was true, so I sent for
you that morning to send you away, and when that
failed and he found us together, I told him that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>307]</a></span>
we loved each other, because I hoped that he would
spare the man I loved, even though he would
never let me&mdash;let me marry that man. I should
have known him too well to think that, but I was
too afraid to reason&mdash;too afraid for your sake.
He was so proud that he would not repeat it to
you as I said it to him: he repeated it in the way
least hateful to him&mdash;and after you had gone, I
found that all I had done served only to make
him try to kill you. Of this I knew nothing until
hours later. Then&mdash;then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The birds had ceased their song, but the scent
of the lilacs still rose from the garden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand now?&rdquo; she asked, her
cheeks crimson in the fading light. &ldquo;I guessed
you did not understand then; but don&rsquo;t you understand
now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stood bewildered. She had to go through
with it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My brother had to live&mdash;you made him live.
To kill himself is the worst disgrace that a Basque
can put upon his family. Besides, the thing was
done; you had fired into the air; nothing that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>308]</a></span>
might do would undo that. At the bridge he
tried to tell you so, but you rode by. You know&mdash;my
brother told it you&mdash;that one reason which
allows a foreigner to marry a Basque. We Eskurolas
pay our debts; to let you go a creditor for
that was to put a stain upon our house indelibly.
I would have accepted the disgrace and made my
brother continue to accept it, had you not now
said that you still loved me; but you have said
it. Oh, do&mdash;do, please, understand!&rdquo; She
stamped her foot. &ldquo;My brother is the last man
of our name. In saving him, you saved the house
of Eskurola.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret was seized by the same impulse toward
hysteria that had seized him when he first faced
Don Ricardo&rsquo;s pistol.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was <em>that</em> what he tried to say at the bridge?
What a fool I was not to listen! If I had all the
world to give, I&rsquo;d give it to you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He tried to seize her hand again, but she drew
it away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; she said, with a crooked smile and a
flaming face, &ldquo;since you say that you love me,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>309]</a></span>
I&mdash;I have to pay the just debt of my house and
save its honor&mdash;I must marry you whether I love
you or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at her with fear renewed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you <em>have</em> changed?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>Suddenly she put her own right hand to her
lips and kissed the fingers on which his lips had
rested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have all the world,&rdquo; she said.... &ldquo;Give
it me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He found both of her hands this time, but still
she kept him from her. The scent of the lilacs
mingled with another scent&mdash;a scent that made
him see again the tall Cantabrians.... Suddenly
he realized that she was wearing her
student-blouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been here&mdash;When did you come back
to Paris?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A week ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To this house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of <em>course</em> I am living in this house as before,
and with your friend Chitta. You know that I
could not have lived anywhere else in Paris. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>310]</a></span>
<em>couldn&rsquo;t</em>. So I took the old room&mdash;the dear little
old room&mdash;again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Before</em> you knew that I still loved you!&rdquo; She
hung her head. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll surely never let you go
this time.&rdquo; He held her hands fast as if fearing
that she might escape him. &ldquo;No custom&mdash;no law&mdash;no
force could take you now. Tell me: would
you have wanted to go back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She freed herself. That newer perfume filled
the purple twilight: the pure perfume of the Azure
Rose that the wandering Basque carries with
him abroad to bring him safely home. She drew
the rose from beneath her blouse and held it out
to him. Cartaret kissed it. She took it back,
kissed it too, went to the nearest window and,
tearing the flower petal from petal, dropped it into
the Paris street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said softly when she had turned to
him again, &ldquo;do not kiss me yet. I want you first
to understand me. I do love my own country, but
I cannot stay in it forever. I was being smothered
there by all the dust of those dead centuries;
I was being slowly crushed by the iron weight of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>311]</a></span>
their old customs and their old laws&mdash;all horribly
alive when they should have been long ago
in their graves. There was nothing around me
that was not old: old walls and towers, ancient
tapestries and arms, musty rooms, yellowed manuscripts.
The age of the place, it seemed to become
a soul-in-itself. It seemed to get a consciousness
and to hate me because I was not as it was. There
was nothing that was not old&mdash;and I was young.&rdquo;
As she remembered it, her face grew almost
sulky. &ldquo;Even if it had not been for you, I believe
I should have come away again. I was so
angry at it all that I could even have put on a
Paquin gown&mdash;if I had had a Paquin gown!&mdash;and
worn it at dinner in the big dining-hall of
my ancestors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He understood. He realized&mdash;none better&mdash;the
hunger and thirst for Paris: for the lights of
the boulevards, the clatter of the dominoes on the
caf&eacute;-tables, the procession of carriages and motors
along the Champs &Eacute;lys&eacute;es, the very cries and
hurry of the rue St. Honor&eacute; by day or the Boul&rsquo;
Miche&rsquo; by night. Nevertheless, he had lately been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>312]</a></span>
an American headed for America, and so he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just wait till you see Broadway!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vitoria smiled, but she remained serious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wanted you to know that&mdash;first,&rdquo; she said:
&ldquo;to know that I came away this second time in
large part because of you, but not wholly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Cartaret, &ldquo;that I can manage
to forgive that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then&mdash;there is something else. You saw
my brother in a great castle and on a great estate,
but he is not rich, and I am very poor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cartaret laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was that what was on your mind? My
dear, <em>I&rsquo;m</em> rich&mdash;I&rsquo;m frightfully rich!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rich?&rdquo; Her tone was all incredulity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It happened the day you left Paris. Oh, I
know I ought to have told you at the castle, but
I forgot it. You see, there was so little time to
talk to you and so many more important things to
say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He told her all about it while the dusk slowly
deepened. Chitta should have a salary for remaining
in a cottage that he would give her in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>313]</a></span>
Alava and never leaving it. He would give his
friends that dinner now&mdash;Houdon and Devignes,
Varachon and Garnier&mdash;a dinner of celebration
at which the host would be present and to which
even Gaston Fran&ccedil;ois Louis Pasbeaucoup and the
elephantine Madame would sit down. There
would be bushels of strawberries. Seraphin would
be pensioned for life, so that he might paint only
the pictures that his heart demanded, and Fourget&mdash;yes,
Cartaret would embrace dear old Fourget
like a true Gaul. In the Luxembourg Gardens
the statues of the old gods smiled and held their
peace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you can study too,&rdquo; said Cartaret.
&ldquo;You can have the best art-masters in the world,
and you shall have them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Vitoria shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is another confession and
the last. I was the more ready to leave Paris
when I ran away from you, because I was disheartened:
the master had told me that I could
never learn, and so I was afraid to face you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>314]</a></span>
&ldquo;Then <em>I&rsquo;ll</em> never paint again,&rdquo; vowed Cartaret.
&ldquo;Pictures? I was successful only when I painted
pictures of you, and why should I paint them when
I have you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that you are rich, but
I am also glad that we have both been poor&mdash;together.
Oh,&rdquo;&mdash;she looked about the familiar
room,&mdash;&ldquo;it needs but one thing more: if only the
street-organ were playing that Scotch song that
it used to play!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it only were!&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;However, we
can&rsquo;t have everything, can we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But lovers, if they only want it enough, can
have everything, and, somehow, the hurdy-gurdy
did, just at that moment, begin to play &ldquo;Annie
Laurie&rdquo; as it used to do, out in the rue du Val-de-Gr&acirc;ce.</p>

<p>Cartaret led her toward the darkened window,
but stopped half-way across the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will try to deserve you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I <em>will</em>
make myself what you want me to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>315]</a></span>
&ldquo;You <em>are</em> that,&rdquo; she answered, her face raised
toward his. &ldquo;All that I ask is to have you with
me always as you are now.&rdquo; The clear contralto
of her voice ran like a refrain to the simple air
of the ballad. &ldquo;I want you with me when you are
unhappy, so that I may comfort you; when you
are ill, so that I may nurse you; when you are
glad, so that I may be glad because you are. I
want to know you in every mood: I want to belong
to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>High over the gleaming roofs, the moon, a disk
of yellow glass, swung out upon the indigo sky
and peeped in at that window. One silver beam
enveloped her. It bathed her lithe, firm figure;
it touched her pure face, her scarlet lips; it made
a refulgent glory of her hair, and, out of it, the
splendor of her wonderful eyes was for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soon,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;in the chapel of Ste.
Jeanne D&rsquo;Arc at the church of St. Germain des
Pr&eacute;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; she said.... &ldquo;Good-night, my
love.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>316]</a></span>
She raised her white hands to him and drew one
step nearer. Then she yielded herself to his arms
and, as they closed, strong and tight, about her,
her own arms circled his neck.</p>

<p>The scent of the Azure Rose returned with her
lips: a vision of mountain-peaks and sunlight upon
crests of snow, a perfume sweeter than the scent
of any rose in any garden, a poem in a language

<p class="center vlrgfont">STORIES OF WESTERN LIFE</p>


<p>TREASURE AND TROUBLE, by Geraldine Bonner.</p>

<p class="smlfont">The wild and glowing golden West; a hold-up; a buried treasure;
outlaws of the excitingly adventurous type, and something new, too,
in the outlaw line in the shape of a Social Pirate; real dyed-in-the-wool
bandits; miners who delve for the riches of the Earth; dazzlingly
beautiful women; youth&mdash;and Love, vivid and beautiful.</p>


<p>THE SHERIFF OF BADGER, by George E. Pattullo.</p>

<p class="smlfont">Lafe Johnson&mdash;strong, brave, big-hearted cowboy of the higher
type&mdash;through his courage in routing a gun-fighter, is hailed as a
hero and made Sheriff of Badger, a ranch town in the Southwest.
The story is more than interesting; it is exciting, and the vein of
romance running through it adds to its strength as a first class breezy
Western ranch yarn.</p>


<p>WOLFVILLE FOLKS, by Alfred Henry Lewis.</p>

<p class="smlfont">Here is another &ldquo;Wolfville&rdquo; book. The characters are of the
picturesque cowboy type. &ldquo;Doc&rdquo; Seely, &ldquo;Cherokee Bill,&rdquo; &ldquo;Faro
Nell,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Rose of Wolfville,&rdquo; etc. The novel is full of Western
philosophy, pistol play, gambling duel, and a remarkable series of
romance and adventures. A lively cowboy novel.</p>


<p>BILLY FORTUNE, by William R. Lighton.</p>

<p class="smlfont">Billy Fortune, able cow-puncher of Wyoming, is a chap for whom
things are always happening. Billy is a lover of life in all its heights
and depths, with a special fondness for the frail sex. There is plenty
of swift comedy action in this story and not a line of melancholy.
And incidentally it gives one a splendid picture of the jocund cow
country of Wyoming.</p>

<p class="smlfont">Author of &ldquo;The Trail of the Waving Palm.&rdquo;</p>

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
